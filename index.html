<p>Sure you may have done FizzBuzz before.  Maybe you have even done it
in Clojure.  But have you done it without the use of <em>any</em>
conditionals?</p>

<p>As your brain starts to work on the <em>how</em> this we be done, you might
be wondering <em>why</em> you should do this in the first place?</p>

<p>There are two very good reasons for this.  The first is that it is a
<em>kata</em>.</p>

<h2>Katas build your code practice</h2>

<p><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/4/3552/3434757877_711709da58_b.jpg"></p>

<p>Code katas build your skill through practice.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter if
you are a beginner or an expert.  Just, like in all those martial arts
movies with the swordsman practicing, so must we.  We stretch and
flex our coding muscles with katas to grow them and keep them in shape.</p>

<p>Yes, you may code every day at work.  But it is not the same as kata
practice.  So much of <em>day to day</em> work involves complexity
with large interconnected concerns.  Our  kata practice cuts the extra
complexity out and leaves you alone with a focused small problem.</p>

<p>The second reason involves why you
should try it, this time,  <em>without conditionals</em>.  The answer is <em>creativity</em>.</p>

<h2>Constraints build creativity.</h2>

<p>It turns out that constraints are a
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/groupthink/2013/07/12/creativity-how-constraints-drive-genius/">key way to drive creativity</a>.
Programming does not only require technical skills, but also
creativity. We are seldom asked to build software without constraints.
It drives design.  Sure, it can be annoying when we have to communicate with
a server that is only active on Tuesday and emits its response in
Morse Code.  But it gives us boundaries to unleash our creative
spirit.</p>

<p>So go for it.</p>

<h2>Give it a try</h2>

<p>Ready?  Here are the details.</p>

<ul>
<li>Given a number, if it number is divisible by 3 return &ldquo;fizz&rdquo;.</li>
<li>If it is divisible by 5 return &ldquo;buzz&rdquo;.</li>
<li>If it is divisible by 3 and 5 return &ldquo;fizzbuzz&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Otherwise, just return the number.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use any conditionals like <em>if</em> <em>else</em> <em>case</em> <em>cond</em>.</li>
</ul>


<p>When you are done, you can check out some of the other solutions. Try
not to peek until you have done your version first though.</p>

<p>(There are some really awesome ones so far).</p>

<p>Recently, I switched from a traditional, &ldquo;go to an office&rdquo;
job,
to working from my home.  It took some time to setup my home
work space and get used to working remotely, but I finally have a
system working for me.  In this post, I thought I would share some things that I
found useful.</p>

<h3>Window Seat Please</h3>

<p>If at all possible, locate your home work space near a window.  The
natural light does wonders for you mood and being able to glance up
and look at trees and real life is a refreshing break from staring at
code all day.</p>

<h3>A Door is Great</h3>

<p>Having a door to your workspace is a real advantage.  It enables you
to close off noise and other activity that might be going on in the
house. It is also <em>incredibly</em> useful if you have small children.  For
my kids, if the door is closed, then it is a sign that Mommy is
working &ndash; do not disturb.</p>

<h3>Invest in a good chair.</h3>

<p>Backs are very important.  I started working from home with just my
kitchen chair &ndash; big mistake.  After a day or two, my back was crying
out for something better. I did some research on good chairs to get
and I ended up with a <a href="http://store.steelcase.com/brochures/leap/">Steelcase Leap Chair</a>.  They are not cheap.
But, I was able to get a refurb one that was considerably less than
new, and my back loves it.</p>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t Sit All the Time</h3>

<p>Even with my great chair, it is not the best to sit constantly.  I had
tried a straight standing desk a while back and I found that standing
<em>all</em> the time was not the best for me.  I prefer to mix it up.  I got
a adjustable <a href="http://www.geekdesk.com/">Geek Desk</a>.  I generally stand
up in the morning and sit in the afternoons.</p>

<h3>Freedom from a Headset with a Good Mic</h3>

<p>I have used a headset before when doing remote calls.  They work fine,
but after a while, I found it annoying to have on my head all day.
I switched to a <a href="http://www.bluemic.com/snowball/">Blue Snowball Mic</a>
at home and am really happy with it.  My voice comes in clear and I am
headset free.</p>

<h3>Dual Monitors for the Win</h3>

<p>I use two Thunderbolt displays.  One monitor I use for communications,
it has my email, chat, and video on it.  The other monitor I use for
the codez.  It works out pretty well to switch back and forth.</p>

<h3>Good Software for Communication</h3>

<p>Good communication is a must for working remotely. Someone cannot just
wander over to your desk and ask you a question.  Here is a list of
communication tools I use at work:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> &ndash; for team communication.</li>
<li>Google Docs</li>
<li><a href="http://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> &ndash; for video and screen sharing.  It is way
better than Google hangouts in terms of video quality.</li>
<li>Apple&rsquo;s Screen sharing &ndash; for pair code development.  This let&rsquo;s
people use whatever editor they are comfortable with, yet you can
see the code and still share control.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Pair Programming is Awesome</h3>

<p>At work, we do pair programming most of the time.  I really like to
work this way.  One of the things that I was concerned about in
switching to remote work was being lonely. Pair programming really
helps in this.  I am usually working with someone during
the day, with one monitor going with video and voice, while the other
monitor has the code we are working on.  For me, it has all the advantages of
idea sharing and group problem solving.  I realize that working this
way is not for everyone, but I am digging it.</p>

<h3>Routine is Everything</h3>

<p>When working for home, I have found it is crucial to have a good
routine.  Since we do a lot of pair programming at work, we all
generally keep the same hours.  Being a distributed team over North
America, this means I start work at around 10am EST.  I have found
that having a routine a sticking to it helps structure my day.  I get
up, get dressed, eat breakfast, just like I was going to work.  Then, I
usually hack for a bit on personal stuff in the morning until it is
time for work.  Then at lunch, I go for a run or work out.  Finally,
and most importantly, in the evening, I leave the computer behind and
devote time to family.</p>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t Forget to Visit with Other Humans</h3>

<p>The downside of working from home is that it is very easy to <em>not</em>
leave home.  At one point, I realized that I had not left the house
for a week.  Not good. I try go to a social event where I will
meet with other developers and friends every week.  There is a nice
developer <a href="https://teamgaslight.com/coffee">coffee group</a> that meets on Fridays.  I also help run our
<a href="https://cincyfp.wordpress.com/">Cincinnati Functional Programmer&rsquo;s
Group</a> here in town.  In general,
I find that if I am driving somewhere and see people walking on the
street and start thinking, &ldquo;Look Humans!&rdquo;, it is time to get out and
socialize a bit more.  Working remotely, makes going to conferences
and being with other developers in person even more fun.</p>

<h3>Summary (with a Dog Pic)</h3>

<p>I have found working remotely to be quite enjoyable so far.  It does
take an extra effort to keep your life structured and communication
flowing properly, but it is worth it.</p>

<p>My next challenge, since it is getting colder, is to get my dog
to sleep on my feet while I work.  No luck so far.</p>

<p>If anyone has
any tips, let me know.</p>

<h2>Green Eggs and Ham</h2>

<p>Transducers are a new feature of Clojure 1.7.  Instead of trying to explain them with words, let&rsquo;s take a look of them in action.  First we need some data.  Let&rsquo;s def a vector of all the places you could try green eggs and ham.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">ns </span><span class="nv">green-eggs.core</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:require</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">clojure.core.async</span> <span class="ss">:as</span> <span class="nv">async</span><span class="p">]))</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">green-eggs-n-ham</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&quot;in the rain&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="s">&quot;on a train&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="s">&quot;in a box&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="s">&quot;with a fox&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="s">&quot;in a house&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="s">&quot;with a mouse&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="s">&quot;here or there&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="s">&quot;anywhere&quot;</span><span class="p">])</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, let&rsquo;s create a function that will transform the places into a &ldquo;I would not eat them &hellip;&rdquo; sentence.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">i-do-not-like-them</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">s</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">format</span> <span class="s">&quot;I would not eat them %s.&quot;</span> <span class="nv">s</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">i-do-not-like-them</span> <span class="s">&quot;in the rain&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;; -&gt; &quot;I would not eat them in the rain.&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We also need a function to take this result and actually try the green eggs and ham.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">try-them</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">s</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">clojure.string/replace</span> <span class="nv">s</span>  <span class="o">#</span><span class="s">&quot; not&quot;</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">try-them</span> <span class="s">&quot;I would not eat them in the rain.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;; -&gt; &quot;I would eat them in the rain.&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we have two transformations that we can apply to the vector of green-eggs-n-ham strings.
One of the really nice things about transducers is that you can describe and compose this transformation without a data structure present.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">sam-i-am-xform</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">comp</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">map </span><span class="nv">i-do-not-like-them</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">map </span><span class="nv">try-them</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We can run the transformation of the transducers against the data in a few ways.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>into</em>: Non-lazy turn the transformation into a collection</li>
<li><em>sequence</em>: Same thing but lazy</li>
<li><em>transduce</em>: Acts like reduce on the all the transformed elements</li>
<li>With <em>core.async</em> channels doing the transformations.</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the green eggs and ham example for each one of these ways:</p>

<h3>Into</h3>

<p>Into takes a transducer and collection to work on and returns the vector we asked for:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">into </span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="nv">sam-i-am-xform</span> <span class="nv">green-eggs-n-ham</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;; -&gt; [&quot;I would eat them in the rain.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     &quot;I would eat them on a train.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     &quot;I would eat them in a box.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     &quot;I would eat them with a fox.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     &quot;I would eat them in a house.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     &quot;I would eat them with a mouse.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     &quot;I would eat them here or there.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     &quot;I would eat them anywhere.&quot;]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Sequence</h3>

<p>Sequence takes similar arguments, but as promised, returns a lazy sequence that we can interact with.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">class </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">sequence</span> <span class="nv">sam-i-am-xform</span> <span class="nv">green-eggs-n-ham</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;; -&gt; clojure.lang.LazyTransformer</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">take </span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">sequence</span> <span class="nv">sam-i-am-xform</span> <span class="nv">green-eggs-n-ham</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;; -&gt; (&quot;I would eat them in the rain.&quot;)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Transduce</h3>

<p>If we want to finally arrange all our sentences in the vectors into one string, we would use reduce.  The way to do this with transducers is to use <em>transduce</em>.  It takes a function of two arguments to perform the reduce, as well as an initial data input.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">transduce</span> <span class="nv">sam-i-am-xform</span> <span class="o">#</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">str </span><span class="nv">%1</span> <span class="nv">%2</span> <span class="s">&quot; &quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class="nv">green-eggs-n-ham</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;; -&gt; &quot;I would eat them in the rain.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     I would eat them on a train.</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     I would eat them with a fox.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     I would eat them in a house.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     I would eat them with a mouse.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     I would eat them here or there.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     I would eat them anywhere.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;_note: In  1.7.0-alpha2, transduce changed and you need to use a</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;(transduce sam-i-am-xform (completing #(str %1 %2 &quot; &quot;)) &quot;&quot; green-eggs-n-ham)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;instead.</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Core.async</h3>

<p>Core.async has a really nice way to define channels with a transducer that will transform each element on the channel.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">sam-i-am-chan</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">async/chan</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="nv">sam-i-am-xform</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Let&rsquo;s define another channel to reduce the results of the sam-i-am-chan to a string.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">result-chan</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">async/reduce</span> <span class="o">#</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">str </span><span class="nv">%1</span> <span class="nv">%2</span> <span class="s">&quot; &quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class="nv">sam-i-am-chan</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s actually put the green-eggs-n-ham data onto the sam-i-am-chan and let the data transformations flow&hellip;.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">async/onto-chan</span> <span class="nv">sam-i-am-chan</span> <span class="nv">green-eggs-n-ham</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At last,
we can get our result off the result channel and revel in the beauty of asynchronous data transducers.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">i-like-them</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">async/&lt;!!</span> <span class="nv">result-chan</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Transducers are elegant and powerful, just like the rest of Clojure.  Try them, you will like them :)</p>

</div>
    </div>
		<p>Sometimes I pause before talking to someone about Clojure code. Not because I am unsure of the code, but because I am unsure of
how to pronounce the code.  The particular code in question is
Clojure&rsquo;s <em>assoc</em>.  I have heard it pronounced two ways. One is
&ldquo;assosh&rdquo;, the other is &ldquo;assok&rdquo;.  So, to determine it, I decided to conduct a
scientific poll of the Clojure community.</p>

<p>I posted the poll on
<a href="https://twitter.com/gigasquid/status/493891057906896896">twitter</a> to
the Cojure community who follow me.  The control group poll was not viewed
by those who do not follow me, and/or, are not on twitter.</p>

<p>The results were startling.</p>

<p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2928/14585605540_6d0ce6169f_n.jpg"></p>

<ul>
<li>assosh &ndash; 10</li>
<li>assok  &ndash; 8</li>
<li>assose &ndash; 2</li>
<li>Jeremy &ndash; 1</li>
<li>asoaksh &ndash; 1</li>
</ul>


<p>The community is clearly deeply divided on this important question.</p>

<p>After sifting through the raw data, I remembered my statistical analysis and threw out the extremes.</p>

<p><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5559/14792182503_12aa682260_n.jpg"></p>

<p>The conclusion was still a stark reality.</p>

<p><em>We do not as a community know how to pronounce assoc.</em></p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>I can only see one way forward.  We must address this as a community.
I propose that the community documentation of <a href="http://clojuredocs.org/">Clojure Docs</a>
and <a href="http://grimoire.arrdem.com/">Grimoire</a> modify their sites to include audio pronunciation like <a href="http://www.macmillandictionary.com/us/media/british/uk_pron/l/lla/llama/llama_British_English_pronunciation.mp3">this</a>.</p>

<p>Remember, I&rsquo;m pulling for you.  We are all in this together.</p>

<p>Nobody knows how it happened.  Some people think it was due to the rapid expansion and adoption of Clojure.  Other people say that the language itself was caused by something deeper and more magical.  No one knows for sure.  All that we really know is that people starting being born with extraordinary powers.  Powers that no human had had before.  They were strange and unique to each person they touched.  The only thing that they all had in common, was that each was an aspect of the Clojure programming language.</p>

<h2>Luke (AKA Lazy Luke)</h2>

<p>Luke was a teenager when his powers came to him.  His mother always complained that he was lazy.  It was true, he did prefer to sleep until noon.  He also had a habit of putting everything off to the last minute, like saving all his papers for the night before they were due.  One day, though, he noticed something very strange.  He could start to see the future.  Well not really “see” it.  But he could see the infinite possibilities  of the future.  Not very far into the future, but enough.  It was a few milliseconds at first.  But now it was up to a full second.  He checked the Clojure Docs as soon as he realized his gift.  It was lazy evaluation and power to deal with infinite sequences.</p>

<h2>Spress</h2>

<p>Spress, whose real name is Emily, came into her power early.  She was
only 5 years old.  Her mother had taken her to a farm to visit with
the animals.  Her mother had pointed at the cow and told her daughter
that it said “Moo”.  Then, at the horse, saying “Neigh”.  Spress
smiled and  pointed at a bucket and said “cow”.  Her mother shook her head at her, but Spress only smiled bigger.  She said “cow” again.  Then, suddenly, the bucket went “Moo”.  She was immediately taken to the Clojure X-Men school, where they identified her power as protocols.  She trained her power and now is so good at solving the “expression problem”, she is known as “Spress”.</p>

<h2>Multi</h2>

<p>Nobody knows Multi’s background.  He came to notice in his early twenties with his powers.  Ordinary humans process sensory input, (like sight, touch, and sound), in an asynchronous fashion.  However, when it gets processed in the brain, it runs into a single pipeline bottleneck  &ndash; consciousness.  Multi’s power is that he can concurrently process his higher level consciousness and reasoning to all this sensory input.  The result is that he can move, think, and perform super fast  and in a super smart way.
He got the power of Clojure’s concurrency.</p>

<h2>Dot</h2>

<p>Dot always had a way with animals.  She had many pets growing up.  Later, she would go into the forest and the animals would seek her out.  She would be found resting by a tree surrounded by deer and birds.  One time, on her walk, she fell down a ditch and had her leg trapped under a log.  Her mother arrived, after searching for her, to see a Bear reach down and gently remove the log.   She stood dumbfounded, as her daughter thanked the bear and it nodded in reply as it turned away.   She could talk with animals effortlessly.  She had the power of Clojure’s Interop.</p>

<h2>Bob</h2>

<p>Bob is the leader of the Clojure X-Men.  He seeks out people with the
power of Clojure and helps train and educate them.  He also is the
most powerful.  He can come into any argument, problem, or challenge
and immediately separate out what is most important to focus on.  He
always knows the right thing to do, without getting bogged down in
unnecessary details .  His power is Clojure’s simplicity.</p>

<p>There might be others out there, we don’t know.  We can only hope, that they are found by Bob and the Clojure X-Men and use their powers for good.</p>

<h2>The Earliest Known Love Song</h2>

<p>The earliest known love song was found in an <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/02/0213_1stlovesong.html">Egyptian tomb</a>.  The
fragment found in the 4,300 year old tomb read:</p>

<pre><code>I love and admire your beauty. I am under it.
</code></pre>

<h2>Medieval Love Songs</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.luminarium.org/medlit/manasseh.jpg"></p>

<p>Moving forward in history to Medieval times, there are many examples
of love songs. One of them from a great composer in the 14th century,
named <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/love-in-the-arts/medieval.html">Guillaume de Machaut</a>:, went something like
this:</p>

<pre><code>You are the true sapphire
that can heal and end all my sufferings,
the emerald which brings rejoicing,
the ruby to brighten and comfort the heart.
</code></pre>

<h2>Love Songs from this Summer</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8d/Coldplay_-_A_Sky_Full_of_Stars_%28Single%29.png"></p>

<p>Love songs abound on the radio and internet today. One was
released by Coldplay recently, called &ldquo;A Sky Full of Stars&rdquo;.
The lyrics go something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Cause you're a sky
Cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm going to give you my heart
Cause you're a sky
Cause you're a sky full of stars
And cause you light up the path
</code></pre>

<h2>Why Create?</h2>

<h3>I have nothing to say that has not been said</h3>

<p>These are the whispering excuses that I hear in the back of my head when
I sit down at a blank text editor:</p>

<ul>
<li>Someone has already said this.</li>
<li>Someone has already built this algorithm.</li>
<li>Someone has already built this library.</li>
<li>I have nothing to say that has not been said before.</li>
</ul>


<h3>But it has not been said by you.</h3>

<p>Love is a universal human emotion.  We have evidence that people have
been writing about it and singing about it for at least 4,000 years.</p>

<p>Hasn&rsquo;t everything already been said about it?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>We still want to hear it again.  We still want to hear it new, said by
another. It means something slightly different, feels different
when said again by someone else with different experiences, from a
different life, from a different perspective..</p>

<p>The same goes for your writing, your code, your library, and your creation.</p>

<p>So open up your favorite editor and brush aside your fears. It is a
blank canvas, ready for your thoughts and code.</p>

<p>Say it loud</p>

<p>Say it strong</p>

<p>Create</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry if it has been said before</p>

<p>It is new because it is said by you</p>

		<p>A while ago, I was <a href="http://gigasquidsoftware.com/blog/2013/05/01/growing-a-language-with-haskell-and-instaparse/">exploring creating a programming language with
Instaparse</a>.
I ended up exploring some concepts of Speech Acts proposed by John
McCarthy by creating my first toy language called
<a href="http://gigasquidsoftware.com/blog/2013/06/04/babar-a-little-language-with-speech-acts-for-machines/">Babar</a>.
Shortly after posting a blog about it, I got an email from someone
saying that I might be interested in a full blown, real programming
language that also incorporated Speech Acts.  I happily started
composing an reply to the email that started off with</p>

<pre><code>That is so cool! ...
</code></pre>

<p>Then I realized that the author of the email and language was none
other than
Frank McCabe,
one of the designers of the
<a href="http://bit.ly/1pJtG0x">Go! programming language</a>
(not to be confused with Google Go).  My brain froze
while it was thinking</p>

<pre><code>"OMG!!!! Frank McCabe, a real language designer, just emailed me!".
</code></pre>

<p>This unfortunately, made the rest of my email reply sound something like
this</p>

<pre><code>Frank,
That is so cool!  herp derp derp Speech Acts herp derp John
McCarthy derp...
</code></pre>

<p>His programming language is the Star
Programming Language.  It was originally developed for use at a company that he
worked at called Starview.  It has since been open sourced and moved
to <a href="https://github.com/fmccabe/star">git</a>.  I finally had a bit a
spare time and I had been itching to give
Star a look.  To my pleasant surprise, despite my initial fumbling
email impression,  Frank was open a friendly to
get me started in it.
I have only scratched the surface in exploring the language, but I
wanted to share my initial impressions, as well as point you to some
<a href="https://github.com/gigasquid/star-lang-katas">beginner katas</a> that I
put together, so that you could join in the fun.</p>

<h2>Crash Overview</h2>

<p>Star is a strongly typed, functional language. It is not a pure
functional language because is allows assignment and stateful objects,
but the language is designed in a way that immutable functional
programming is encouraged. The feel of the language is concise but
human readable.</p>

<blockquote><p>Star is a coherent, general-purpose programming language that<br/>    combines elements from a wide variety of existing languages as<br/>    well as adding innovative elements of its own. Star inherits func-<br/>    tional programming in general, a Haskell-style type system, an F#-<br/>    style monad for parallel computations, and Concurrent ML for or-<br/>    chestrating concurrent and parallel applications.</p><footer><strong>Feel different on the Java platform: the star programming language</strong> <cite><a href='http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2500837&dl=ACM&coll=DL&CFID=354902651&CFTOKEN=90319052'>dl.acm.org/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<h3>Hello World</h3>

<p>The best way to get a feel for it is to look at a few examples.  Of
course, let&rsquo;s start off with Hello World.</p>

<p>Another way of doing our Hello World is in a worksheet.
This feature is still in the works, but it will likely turn into a
replacement for a REPL, being integrated into the editor.  The import
statement will also soon not be required.  But a nice feature of using
the worksheeet is that is a combined module and transcript of the
session.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here is what the output looks like:</p>

<pre><code>Jun 11, 2014 11:21:09 AM  
INFO: "hello world" -&gt; "hello world" at 4
info: execution took 0.053684428
</code></pre>

<h3>Pattern Matching</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at another example.  This time a naive fib function
with pattern matching.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">import</span> <span class="nn">worksheet</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">worksheet</span><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Notice how the fib function is defined with pattern matching.  Also
how the keyword &ldquo;is&rdquo; is used instead of an &ldquo;=&rdquo; to make the code flow
more readable (IMO).</p>

<p>The output of running the program is:</p>

<pre><code>Jun 11, 2014 3:32:38 PM  
INFO: fib(0) = 0 ok at 9
Jun 11, 2014 3:32:38 PM  
INFO: fib(1) = 1 ok at 10
Jun 11, 2014 3:32:38 PM  
INFO: fib(3) = 2 ok at 11
Jun 11, 2014 3:32:38 PM  
INFO: fib(10) = 55 ok at 12
info: execution took 0.039725132
</code></pre>

<h3>Pattern Matching with Guards</h3>

<p>The declaration of pattern matching for functions can also include
guards like in this fizzbuzz example</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">fizzbuzz</span> <span class="n">has</span> <span class="kr">type</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">integer</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">string</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Also note the type declaration.  The type declaration is optional.
The complier is smart enough to figure it out.  Sometimes it is more
readable to include the type declaration.  But, it can be left out for
more concise code.</p>

<h3>Cons Lists</h3>

<p>One of the important collection types are cons lists. These are lists
that you add to the front of and are destructed as the first element
and then the rest of the list. To construct a cons list:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'> <span class="n">testNumbers</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">cons</span> <span class="kr">of</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">13</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">14</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To use a cons list in a function with pattern matching:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">listFizzBuzz</span> <span class="n">has</span> <span class="kr">type</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cons</span> <span class="kr">of</span> <span class="n">integer</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">cons</span> <span class="kr">of</span> <span class="n">string</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">listFizzBuzz</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">nil</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">nil</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">listFizzBuzz</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cons</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">cons</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fizzbuzz</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">listFizzBuzz</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The function listFizzBuzz takes in a list of integers and turns it
into a list of strings using the fizzbuzz function. If we evaluate:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">testNumbers</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">cons</span> <span class="kr">of</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">13</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">14</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">result</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">listFizzBuzz</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">testNumbers</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The result will look like</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">cons</span> <span class="kr">of</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">&quot;1&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;2&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;fizz&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;4&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;buzz&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;fizz&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;7&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;8&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;fizz&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;buzz&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;11&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;fizz&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;13&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;14&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;fizzbuzz&quot;</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There are other collection types such as arrays and relations, (which
are really cool &ndash; you can do queries on them like a database), but I haven&rsquo;t explored them well enough to really
talk about yet.</p>

<h3>Actors and Speech Acts</h3>

<p>Star has actors that use three Speech Acts: Notify, Request, and
Query.  The actors themselves can also be concurrent. I explored the
Speech Act/ Actor model with an example from John McCarthy&rsquo;s
<a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/elephant/elephant.html">Elephant 2000 paper</a>,
which is a Airline Reservation system.</p>

<p>To use the notify speech act, you need to define what type the
notifications are on the actors channel.  In my case, the
notifications are either going to be a book(string) method, or a
cancel(string) method.  To book a reservation for a person or cancel
it.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>There is some extra things in the code, but for right now, look at the
book and cancel methods.  These are the functions that will be called
when the actor is notified like this:</p>

<a href="https://github.com/fmccabe/star">https://github.com/fmccabe/star</a>.
Checkout out the tests.  There are tons of sample star programs
that cover the language&rsquo;s features.</p></li>

		<p>Once you have your <a href="http://gigasquidsoftware.com/blog/2014/03/19/walking-with-hexapods/">hexapod assembled and running using the hand held
controller</a>,
of course, your thoughts naturally turn to world domination.</p>

<h2>The most powerful tool in the world is the Clojure REPL</h2>

<p>World domination requires the most powerful tools available.  That of
course calls for Clojure and the Clojure REPL.  I recommend Emacs
as the editor of choice of such an endeavor.  However, it if you are
content with city, state, or single country domination, other editors
that support Clojure are also fine.</p>

<h2>Connect the XBee to your computer</h2>

<p>First, we need to get the computer to talk to the hexapod wirelessly.
We can do this with a <a href="http://www.trossenrobotics.com/uartsbee">USB to Serial adapter</a>
that uses the paired XBee from the handheld commander.</p>

<p>Take the XBee from the handheld commander</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3698/13278059985_f5b5c01819_n.jpg"></p>

<p>and move it to the USB to serial adapter</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7067/13298779543_f69a14b42c_n.jpg"></p>

<p>Now plug the usb into your computer.</p>

<h2>Get your Clojure ready</h2>

<p>In your clojure project, the only magic you need is the <a href="https://github.com/samaaron/serial-port">Serial Port library</a>. Import the library and list your serial ports.  Then open the one that shows up for you.</p>

<p>Since we are going to be talking to the hexapod.  We need to send the commands in the same format that it is expecting. Basically, a packet of where the postions of the joystick are, as well as what buttons are pushed.</p>

<p>If you want to see the code, it is out on github as <a href="https://github.com/gigasquid/clj-hexapod">clj-hexapod</a>.  Please keep in mind that it is early days still, and I am still just exploring.</p>

<h2>Phoneix Code Firmware</h2>

<p>It is worth noting the the above code was meant to run with the default hexapod firmware.  That is the &ldquo;Nuke&rdquo; firmware.  There is another firmware, the <a href="https://github.com/KurtE/Arduino_Phoenix_Parts">Phoenix code</a>, that gives the hexapod more lifelike moves and allows it to twist and shift is rather creepy ways.</p>

<p>I just loaded it on the hexapod yesterday.  The commander software changed too, so I will of course need to revisit the code, to add in the new moves.  But here is a sneak preview of what it can do:</p>

<div class="ratio-4-3 embed-video-container" onclick="var myAnchor = document.getElementById('PmBGt9T-yvI');var tmpDiv = document.createElement('div');tmpDiv.innerHTML = '&lt;iframe style=&quot;vertical-align:top;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/PmBGt9T-yvI?autoplay=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;';myAnchor.parentNode.replaceChild(tmpDiv.firstChild, myAnchor);return false;" title="click here to play">
<a class="youtube-lazy-link" style="width:100%;height:100%;background:#000 url(http://i2.ytimg.com/vi/PmBGt9T-yvI/0.jpg) center center no-repeat;background-size:contain;position:absolute" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmBGt9T-yvI" id="PmBGt9T-yvI" onclick="return false;">
<div class="youtube-lazy-link-div"></div>
<div class="youtube-lazy-link-info">Hexapod with Phoenix Code</div>
</a>
<div class="video-info" ></div>
</div>


<p><em>That is my daughter singing in the background</em></p>

<h2>That&rsquo;s all for now</h2>

<p>I hope I have given you pointers for getting started on your own world domination with Clojure and Hexapods. Remember to practice your laugh &hellip;. Muhahaha :)</p>

<p>Here we see the <a href="http://www.trossenrobotics.com/phantomx-ax-hexapod.aspx">PhantomX Hexapod</a> thriving in the natural habitat of a
cozy, climate controlled, modern house. But there was a time before
the hexapod.  In particular, there was a time of many hexapod parts
and a high level software developer that somehow, despite her natural
lack of mechanical skills, managed to bring it to life. This blog post
endeavors to chronicle the high and low points of this journey. And
perhaps, will make it easier for any other brave souls that would like
to bring the <em>Age of Hexapods</em> into their homes.</p>

<h2>Oh My! So Many Parts</h2>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t really mentally prepared for the vast amounts of parts in the
kit.  Here is a sampling:</p>

<ul>
<li>18 AX-12A Servos</li>
<li>Top/ Bottom Body Plate</li>
<li>20 Brackets</li>
<li>Arbotix Board</li>
<li>2 Xbees</li>
<li>Lipo Battery &amp; Charger</li>
<li>Arbotix programmer</li>
<li>19 Cables</li>
<li><strong>50,000 nuts and screws </strong> (Really only about 850 &ndash; but you get my
 point)</li>
</ul>


<h2>First Things First</h2>

<p>The very first thing to do is to make sure that you have all the
parts.  Once I went through the checklist and double counted all my
screws, I was relieved to go onto the next task of programming the
Arbotix and assign ids to servos and center them. These steps
consisted of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Getting the Arduino IDE going</li>
<li>Loading the Drivers and Libraries</li>
<li>Loading the ROS (Robot Operating System) on the Arbotix Board, so
that it could be used to program the servos.</li>
</ul>


<p>Each of the servos have to be assigned a number. This will let the
program know which part of the leg is which, so that it will
eventually &ndash; hopefully, be able to walk. Once the id is given, a
sticker is labeled on the servo for future use. Centering the servos
is a VERY important step not to overlook.  If you do not center the
servos, you will get into the unfortunate circumstance of having to
dissemble the robot, cry, recenter the servos, and then reassemble the
robot. Please avoid.</p>

<h2>Putting It Together</h2>

<p>The assembly starts with the feet and legs first.
I was so pleased when I got the feet assembled, that I considered
knitting little baby hexapod booties.</p>

<p>Next a servo and the tibia is added</p>

<p>Another servo and the tibia and femur is assembled</p>

<p>Finally, another servo and the whole leg is assembled</p>

<h2>Newbie Advice</h2>

<p>I would like to pause for a minute to share some advice from my trial
and errors in assembly thus far:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t overtighten screws </strong> &ndash; More is not better. It makes things
like plexiglass frames crack and break.</li>
<li><strong>Seating nuts in servos is hard</strong> &ndash; This isn&rsquo;t really advice. Just
moral support in your struggle.  There are 18 servos and up to 20
nuts to seat in each servo.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assembling the body</h2>

<p>The body is where the board, battery and and cables go.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3755/13278197953_44717aea96.jpg"></p>

<p>At long last, the legs can be attached to the body &ndash; with 120 screws
of course.</p>

<h2>Round two of Newbie Advice</h2>

<ul>
<li>For those who have never stripped wires and attached them to power
supplies, like me, please mind that the wires are twisted so that
the edges don&rsquo;t fray out and short out everything requiring you to
re-assign all the servos that lost their ids and much unscrewing,
crying, and reassembling.</li>
<li>When programming the Arbotix board.  You must remove the Xbee, or it
will not work.</li>
<li>Also, did I mention not over-tightening screws? Also, the order in
which you tighten the screws is important too.  Try to tighten them
all loosely in order, so you don&rsquo;t stress the fiberglass parts and
have something like this happen.</li>
</ul>

<h2>It is Alive!</h2>

<p>Finally, the moment of truth. The hexapod is assembled and it is time
to upload a test check on the board to make sure that everything is
working alright.</p>

<div class="ratio-4-3 embed-video-container" onclick="var myAnchor = document.getElementById('i9St8kDuyqU');var tmpDiv = document.createElement('div');tmpDiv.innerHTML = '&lt;iframe style=&quot;vertical-align:top;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/i9St8kDuyqU?autoplay=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;';myAnchor.parentNode.replaceChild(tmpDiv.firstChild, myAnchor);return false;" title="click here to play">

<h2>Walking with Hexapods</h2>

<p>The kit comes with a commander that you assemble of course.  You can
use it to control the hexapod with hand-held joysticks.</p>

<p>The moment of truth, when it finally took its very first steps, and the Age of Hexapods began.</p>
