I really love the London.  I have only been once many years ago,
but I was enchanted.  Here is a partial list of my favorite
things:

* Ducks in Regent's Park
* Tea Rooms
* The Food Hall at Harrod's
* The British Museum
* English Breakfasts
* The way the British put an extra "r" in phrases like "vanilla in it"

As you know, I also adore Clojure. So I am absolutely thrilled to combine the two.

## Clojure Exchange

I will be speaking at the
[Clojure eXchange conference](http://skillsmatter.com/event/java-jee/clojure-exchange-2013)
on December 6th.  The talk is a bit odd, (like me), and will have
Clojure, parsers, sea monsters, philosophy, and an AR Drone in it.  It
should be a lot of fun.

I really looking forward to get a chance to meet the London Clojure
community in person. Hope to see you there.

P.S. If anyone has any tips on flying overseas with an AR Drone.
Please let me know :)
