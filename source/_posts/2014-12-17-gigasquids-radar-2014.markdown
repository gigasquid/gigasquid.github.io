It's that time of year for _radars_ to be published.  So this year, I thought I would publish one of my own. Here is what is on my radar.


## Languages

* *Adopt*: Clojure - It is fantastic language. Really.
* *Trial*: [Pixie](https://github.com/pixie-lang/pixie) - The promise of a really fast startup Clojure inspired language.  I am impressed already and it is only a few months old.
* *Assess*: [Idris](http://www.idris-lang.org/) - I have only seen this lang briefly, but was impressed by the typing and proofing abilities.
* *Hold*: JavaScript - I don't have to say more, you know what I mean.

## Cute Animals

* *Adopt*: [Llamas](http://www.llamas.org/imgs/corner.jpg)
* *Trial*: [Alpacas](http://www.preciousanimals.com/wp-content/plugins/woo-tumblog/functions/thumb.php?src=wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Cute-Animals-4e41e26ba45d7.jpg&w=530&h=&zc=1&q=90)
* *Assess*: [Wombats](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/08/27/article-0-20D869FB00000578-191_634x758.jpg)
* *Hold*: [Hedgehogs](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-expAkvezlsw/UjJIGE3EqMI/AAAAAAAABoo/UcCeUo7ALtc/s1600/cute-hedgehog-dino-toy.jpg)


## Robots

* *Adopt*: [Parrot AR Drone](http://ardrone2.parrot.com/) Hackable flying drone with sonar and cameras. Doesn't injure your fingers too much when you get them caught in the blades.
* *Trial*: [PhantomX Hexapod](http://gigasquidsoftware.com/blog/2014/03/20/world-domination-with-hexapods-and-clojure/) A bit pricey and delicate, but built from kit and is super cool when you get it going.
* *Assess*: [Myo Armband](https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/) Control things with a flick of your wrist.  Mine finally arrived after a year and a half wait.  I haven't had time to play with it, but I have high hopes for it.
* *Hold*: Roombas - I love my Roombas, but I am not sure the latest models have an ROI port to hack :(


## Tasty Food

* *Adopt*: [Crumpets](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Buttered_crumpet2.jpg) - Put lots of butter on them toasted. Yum!
* *Trial*: [Mint Tim Tams](http://www.aussiefoodshop.com/i/peppe%20biscuits/dark_choc_mint.JPG)-  Minty, just the right amount of crunch. Hard to find in the US, but a treat when you do.
* *Assess*: [Raclette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raclette) - I have never actually had it, but it is melted cheese, it has to be incredible.
* *Hold*: Egg Nog - Don't drink it directly from the bowl.



Happy Holidays Everyone!
