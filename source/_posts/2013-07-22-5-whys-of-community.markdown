## Why do you devote time and participate in the community?

1) *Why do you devote time and participate in the community?*

I find joy in coding and making things. I want to be around other
people who feel the same way.

2) *Why?*

Because I want to be inspired by others and learn from others and hope that they are inspired and learn from me.

3) *Why?*

Because ideas and learning doesn't happen in a vacuum. There is something magical about the serendipity of human interaction and that needs a community to take place.

4) *Why?*

It is all fundamentally about people. People dream. We talk about our dreams and get together and make them reality. That is the magic of our civilization.

5) *Why?*

I don't want to dream alone.
