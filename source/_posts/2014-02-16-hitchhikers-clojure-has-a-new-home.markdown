The Hitchhiker's Guide to Clojure posts now have a new home to make it
easier to read them in a chronological fashion.

[http://hitchhikersclojure.com/](http://hitchhikersclojure.com/)

There is also a public [repo](https://github.com/gigasquid/hitchhikers-clojure) - feel free to contribute spelling and
grammar fixes, or your great ideas.
