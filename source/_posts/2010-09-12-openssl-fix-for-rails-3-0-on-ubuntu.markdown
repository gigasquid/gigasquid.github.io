If you are trying to run ruby rvm and rails 3.0 on Ubuntu you might run into this problem when you start up you server.

    
    LoadError: no such file to load
    -- openssl
    


After much googling and researching â€“ just installing the openssl library on your system won't fix the problem.  You need to recompile and install your rvm ruby version with the openssl.  I found this fixed it for me.

    
    rvm install 1.9.2-p0 -C --with-openssl-dir=$rvm_path/usr
    


There is also another solution
