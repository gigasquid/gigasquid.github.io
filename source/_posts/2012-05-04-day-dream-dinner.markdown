In a day dream, I met a genie.  He kindly offered to setup my dream dinner for me.  All I had to do was name six guests and they would receive gilt invitations to the best restaurant in the world.  Of course, they would all be delighted to attend and would be spared the nuisance of travel arrangements by handy magical teleportation.  I hesitated for a moment, there are so many people that I would like to name.  The genie tapped his foot impatiently.  Alright here they are:
