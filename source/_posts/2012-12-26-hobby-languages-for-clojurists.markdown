I spend most of my work day in Ruby and CoffeeScript. However, my true love belongs to Clojure, which I consider my "hobby" language right now. I started to wonder, what are the "hobby" languages for people who spend most of their work day with Clojure. My informal twitter poll revealed selection as diverse and interesting as the Clojurists themselves.
