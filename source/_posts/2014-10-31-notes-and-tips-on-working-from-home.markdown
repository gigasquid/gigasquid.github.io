Recently, I switched from a traditional, "go to an office"
job, 
to working from my home.  It took some time to setup my home
work space and get used to working remotely, but I finally have a
system working for me.  In this post, I thought I would share some things that I
found useful.


### Window Seat Please
If at all possible, locate your home work space near a window.  The
natural light does wonders for you mood and being able to glance up
and look at trees and real life is a refreshing break from staring at
code all day.

### A Door is Great
Having a door to your workspace is a real advantage.  It enables you
to close off noise and other activity that might be going on in the
house. It is also _incredibly_ useful if you have small children.  For
my kids, if the door is closed, then it is a sign that Mommy is
working - do not disturb.

### Invest in a good chair.
Backs are very important.  I started working from home with just my
kitchen chair - big mistake.  After a day or two, my back was crying
out for something better. I did some research on good chairs to get
and I ended up with a [Steelcase Leap Chair](http://store.steelcase.com/brochures/leap/).  They are not cheap.
But, I was able to get a refurb one that was considerably less than
new, and my back loves it.


### Don't Sit All the Time
Even with my great chair, it is not the best to sit constantly.  I had
tried a straight standing desk a while back and I found that standing
_all_ the time was not the best for me.  I prefer to mix it up.  I got
a adjustable [Geek Desk](http://www.geekdesk.com/).  I generally stand
up in the morning and sit in the afternoons.

### Freedom from a Headset with a Good Mic
I have used a headset before when doing remote calls.  They work fine,
but after a while, I found it annoying to have on my head all day.
I switched to a [Blue Snowball Mic](http://www.bluemic.com/snowball/)
at home and am really happy with it.  My voice comes in clear and I am
headset free.

### Dual Monitors for the Win
I use two Thunderbolt displays.  One monitor I use for communications,
it has my email, chat, and video on it.  The other monitor I use for
the codez.  It works out pretty well to switch back and forth.

### Good Software for communication
Good communication is a must for working remotely. Someone cannot just
wander over to your desk and ask you a question.  Here is a list of
communication tools I use at work:

* [Slack](https://slack.com/) - for team communication.
* Google Docs
* [Zoom](http://zoom.us/) - for video and screen sharing.  It is way
  better than Google hangouts in terms of video quality.
* Apple's Screen sharing - for pair code development.  This let's
  people use whatever editor they are comfortable with, yet you can
  see the code and still share control.

### Pair Programming is Awesome
At work, we do pair programming most of the time.  I really like to
work this way.  One of the things that I was concerned about in
switching to remote work was being lonely. Pair programming really
helps in this.  I am usually working with someone during
the day, with one monitor going with video and voice, while the other
monitor has the code we are working on.  For me, it has all the advantages of
idea sharing and group problem solving.  I realize that working this
way is not for everyone, but I am digging it.


### Routine is Everything
When working for home, I have found it is crucial to have a good
routine.  Since we do a lot of pair programming at work, we all
generally keep the same hours.  Being a distributed team over North
America, this means I start work at around 10am EST.  I have found
that having a routine a sticking to it helps structure my day.  I
usually hack for a bit on personal stuff in the morning until it is
time for work.  Then at lunch, I go for a run or work out.  Finally,
and most importantly, in the evening, I leave the computer behind and
devote time to family.

### Don't Forget to Visit with Other Humans
The downside of working from home is that it is very easy to _not_
leave home.  At one point, I realized that I had not left the house
for a week.  Not good. I try go to a social event where I will
meet with other developers and friends every week.  There is a nice
developer coffee group that meets on Fridays.  I also help run our
[Cincinnati Functional Programmer's
Group](https://cincyfp.wordpress.com/) here in town.  In general,
I find that if I am driving somewhere and see people walking on the
street and start thinking, "Look Humans!", it is time to get out and
socialize a bit more.  Working remotely, makes going to conferences
and being with other developers in person even more fun.


### Summary (with a Dog Pic)

I have found working remotely to be quite enjoyable so far.  It does
take an extra effort to keep your life structured and communication
flowing properly, but it is worth it.

Now that it is getting colder, I am trying to work on getting my dog
to sleep on my feet while I work, but so far no luck.

If anyone has
any tips, let me know.
