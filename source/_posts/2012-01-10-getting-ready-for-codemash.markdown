Only one more day until [CodeMash](http://codemash.org/).  I am really looking forward to my first one.  I have heard nothing but wonderful things about this conference that brings together developers, geeks and their families for a week in January in Sandusky, Ohio.

I am also looking forward to the opportunity of presenting my "Once Upon a Time in Clojureland" talk.  It is an introduction to Clojure in a Fairy Tale format.  I am hoping to share my enthusiasm for the language and inspire others to try it out for themselves.

If you haven't seen it, you should check out the [Mashed Code Magazine](http://www.mashedcodemagazine.com/).  It is full of awesome.  It also contains a piece that I wrote under my super secret identity.  Hint, it is about Monads :)

Well off to pack and get things organized.  I'll post my full coverage in the following days ...
