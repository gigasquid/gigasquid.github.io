I have put a couple projects out on GitHub to help people get started with Clojure and Ruby.
The Katas are taken more or less from the Coding Kata site [http://codingkata.org/katas/](http://codingkata.org/katas/). The projects both include the basic project setup for you to get started with TDD beginner katas.

The Ruby project has tests in the form of rspec-given, which is quite fun. The Clojure project has tests in the form of Midje, which has a lovely syntax.

Please give them a try :)
