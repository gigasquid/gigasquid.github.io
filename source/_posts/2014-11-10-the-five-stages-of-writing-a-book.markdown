1.  _Denial_: I am not really writing a book.
2.  _Anger_: Why did I ever decide to write a book?
3.  _Bargaining_: If I just finish this book, I promise never to write another one.
4.  _Depression_: I am never going to finish this book.
5.  _Resolution_: I am writing a book and I am going to give it my _frigging all_.
