You don't really understand how important someone is in your life
until they are suddenly gone. I have had the honor and privilege of
working, playing, and laughing alongside Jim Weirich for the last few
years.  He was an amazing man.  I miss him dearly.

##Think##
Jim taught us how to think about computer programming. I once had a
Physics professor tell me not to worry so
much about the formulas and math. The most important thing was how to
**think**.
Everything thing after that would
naturally fall into place.  Jim embodied that philosophy for
programming.  The languages and algorithms poured almost
effortlessly from his masterful fingers.  He knew how to **think** about
the problem, observe from a multitude of angles.  Finally, bringing his
experience, creativity, and humility to bear on it, he would shape it into
a beautiful piece of code.

##Make##
Jim showed us how to make. He was a master craftsman and a maker. The
care and joy that infused his work was inspiring.  He loved the
process of Test Driven Development. Green tests were always a
celebration. The surprise of beautiful code emerging from a
refactoring was treated as a gift.  He is best known for his
[Rake](https://github.com/jimweirich/rake) build tool, but his testing
library [rspec-given](https://github.com/jimweirich/rspec-given) is
one that reminds me most of him and the way that he loved to craft code.

##Care##
Jim showed us how to care.  Jim cared deeply about each and every
person.  While flying his drone in the office hallway, he would wave
down a passing building maintenance worker and ask if they wanted to
fly it.  Over the course of the next few minutes, Jim would put them
completely at ease and chat happily with them.  He was like that to
**everyone**.  In the few days after
his passing, many building workers, and people from other offices, that
I only ever nodded at in passing, stopped by to give their sincere
condolences his loss. He is without a doubt, the kindest person I have
ever known.  He took great joy in his faith and in his family.  He
would talk about his family all the time and how much they enjoyed
each others company.  He is without a doubt, one of the personally richest men I have ever known.


##Share##
Jim taught us how to share. Jim wanted to share his knowledge.  He was
a great teacher and presenter. He gave engaging presentations that
took people on a journey with him, not only imparting knowledge, but
becoming friends with him in the process.  He was a pillar in the local
Cincinnati technical community. He is the reason why myself and
countless others were drawn to Ruby and the Ruby community.


##Dream##
Jim dreamed with us.  Jim was a creative. He was also a singer, song
writer, musician, and artist.  He brought that creative spirit,
curiosity, and love of learning to the technical world. I will cherish
our lunches spent together flying our AR Drones, sometimes crashing
them into walls and each other, while trying to find creative ways of
controlling them with code.  He was just lately exploring with the
micro-quadcopters like the
[crazyflie](http://www.bitcraze.se/crazyflie/).
We had plans to make all our Spheros, Roombas, big drones, and little
drones dance to live coded music. We were both auditing on
[Autonomous Mobile Robots](https://www.edx.org/course/ethx/ethx-amrx-autonomous-mobile-robots-1342)
to see what we could learn to help us with our robot dreams.


I miss him dearly.  I will cherish my memories of him and I am so
grateful for all the ways he has enriched my life.  I will remember
that when I dream in code, he is still there with me.

Until that day when we will fly our friendly robots together again.
