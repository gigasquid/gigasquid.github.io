Sometimes I pause before talking to someone about Clojure code. Not because I am unsure of the code, but because I am unsure of
how to pronounce the code.  The particular code in question is
Clojure's _assoc_.  I have heard it pronounced two ways. One is
"assosh", the other is "assok".  So, to determine it, I decided to conduct a
scientific poll of the Clojure community.

I posted the poll on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/gigasquid/status/493891057906896896) to
the Cojure community who follow me.  The control group poll was viewed
by those who do not follow me, and/or, are not on twitter.

The results were startling.

* assosh - 10
* assok  - 8
* assose - 3
* Jeremy - 1
* asoaksh - 1

The community is clearly deeply divided on this important question.

After sifting through the raw data, I remembered my statistical analysis and threw out the extremes.

The conclusion was still a stark reality.

*We do not as a community know how to pronounce assoc.*


## Solution

I can only see one way forward.  We must address this as a community.
I propose that the community documentation of [Clojure Docs](http://clojuredocs.org/)
and [Grimoire](http://grimoire.arrdem.com/) modify their sites to include audio pronunciation like [this](http://www.macmillandictionary.com/us/media/british/uk_pron/l/lla/llama/llama_British_English_pronunciation.mp3).

Remember, I'm pulling for you.  We are all in this together.
