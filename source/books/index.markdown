I am the author of [Living Clojure](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034292.do?sortby=publicationDate) by O'Reilly.  It is both an introduction and
training plan for developers to learn Clojure.

The writing of the booking was inspired
after being introduced to a running program called _Ease into 5K_.
Before trying the program, I had tried running on my own.  Each time,
I ended up quitting before too long.  I thought that I just wasn't cut
out for running.  But in reality, I tried to do _too much too
fast_.  After hearing someone say that they had tried to pick up
Clojure over the weekend, didn't get too far, and didn't think Clojure
was for them,  I made the connection.  Doing _too much too fast_,
isn't only a problem with learning to run, but also a problem with
learning programming languages.  The reason I had finally succeeded
with running was that I gradually worked myself up over a course of
seven weeks.  The book also follows this methodology.  The first half
of the book is a guided introduction to Clojure and some of its key
libraries.  The second half of the book is a structured set of daily
exercises over a course of seven weeks that will give your brain a
gradual doses of functional programming that will have you _living_
Clojure at the end.

## Code Shifter
 I'm busy working on writing a middle grade, fantasy/sci-fi novel featuring a coding heroine as well as real programming concepts and Clojure code.

For the last twelve years, Eliza Blackthorn has led an ordinary life with her family.  Growing up in this town is especially easy since the government’s AI takes care of everything. The price for all this convenience is freedom, especially the freedom to code.  All technical knowledge is strictly controlled by the citadel.

When Eliza's older brother is drafted to the citadel work as an informatic slave,  a strange power awakes in her that allows her to visualize and “push” code with her mind.  The only problem is that she trips the hacking alarms in process.  Now, she’s on the run from both the AI and its terrifying hexdog robots. Can she make it to the Underground Programmer’s Academy and learn enough to rescue her brother from the citadel before his brain is scrambled for good?
