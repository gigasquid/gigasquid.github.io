I am the author of [Living Clojure](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034292.do?sortby=publicationDate) by O'Reilly.  It is both an introduction and
training plan for developers to learn Clojure.

The writing of the booking was inspired
after being introduced to a running program called _Ease into 5K_.
Before trying the program, I had tried running on my own.  Each time,
I ended up quitting before too long.  I thought that I just wasn't cut
out for running.  But in reality, I tried to do _too much too
fast_.  After hearing someone say that they had tried to pick up
Clojure over the weekend, didn't get too far, and didn't think Clojure
was for them,  I made the connection.  Doing _too much too fast_,
isn't only a problem with learning to run, but also a problem with
learning programming languages.  The reason I had finally succeeded
with running was that I gradually worked myself up over a course of
seven weeks.  The book also follows this methodology.  The first half
of the book is a guided introduction to Clojure and some of its key
libraries.  The second half of the book is a structured set of daily
exercises over a course of seven weeks that will give your brain a
gradual doses of functional programming that will have you _living_
Clojure at the end.

Twelve year old Eliza discovers she has the power to change a machine’s code just by touch. When the government’s evil artificial intelligence takes her brother away, she uses her new ability to fight back. Now she's on the run as an outlaw and her only hope to save him is to find the Underground Programmer’s Academy. She needs to learn how to control her powers and fast. If she doesn’t get her brother back in time, his brain could be scrambled forever. 

Together, with her friends, Eliza sets out on an adventure that involves learning code, fighting robots, and finding out how strong she can be.
