I am the author of [Living Clojure](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034292.do?sortby=publicationDate) by O'Reilly.  It is both an introduction and
training plan for developers to learn Clojure.

The writing of the booking was inspired
after being introduced to a running program called _Ease into 5K_.
Before trying the program, I had tried running on my own.  Each time,
I ended up quitting before too long.  I thought that I just wasn't cut
out for running.  But in reality, I tried to do _too much too
fast_.  After hearing someone say that they had tried to pick up
Clojure over the weekend, didn't get too far, and didn't think Clojure
was for them,  I made the connection.  Doing _too much too fast_,
isn't only a problem with learning to run, but also a problem with
learning programming languages.  The reason I had finally succeeded
with running was that I gradually worked myself up over a course of
seven weeks.  The book also follows this methodology.  The first half
of the book is a guided introduction to Clojure and some of its key
libraries.  The second half of the book is a structured set of daily
exercises over a course of seven weeks that will give your brain a
gradual doses of functional programming that will have you _living_
Clojure at the end.

## Code Shifter
 I'm busy working on writing a middle grade, fantasy/sci-fi novel featuring a coding heroine as well as real programming concepts and Clojure code.  I would give you a completion date, but I've found that [Hofstadter's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law) seems to hold true for writing books as well as coding. It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take it Hofstadter's law into account.
