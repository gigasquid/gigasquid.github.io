I started off as a professional ballet dancer, studied Physics in college, and ended up as a Software Developer.

I live in Loveland, OH with my husband and two children.  We have a dog, hamster and a large garden with a small flock of chickens. When the garden is doing well, I try my hand at canning and freezing.  Any surplus of zucchinis are left on the porches of neighbors or on the desks of co-workers.

My current tech interests are Clojure, AI, and Robots.

When I am left to daydream, I think of the dynamics of flocks of birds, what the Giant Squids might really be doing down there in the deep, and maybe opening a first-rate cheese shop one day.
