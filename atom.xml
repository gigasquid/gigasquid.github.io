    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Clojure&rsquo;s <em>partition</em> and <em>partition-all</em> functions are very useful.
However, I have been bitten a few times using <em>partition</em> when I
really wanted <em>partition-all</em>.  So to help myself and all of you to
remember it, I have made some diagrams with <a href="http://www.designswan.com/archives/the-pugs-of-westeros-cute-pugs-dressed-up-like-characters-in-game-of-thrones.html">pugs from the Game of Thrones</a></p>

<p>In code, <a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/partition">partition</a> takes a collection and returns a lazy sequence of
lists, each containing n items.</p>

<p>To demonstrate this with pugs, we will partition 5 pugs into groups of
twos.</p>

<p><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7301/15757758964_570d260a31_c.jpg"></p>

<p>This partition will give you two groups of two pugs.</p>

<p><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7350/16380203235_91c8c4e9ee_c.jpg"></p>

<p>Notice, (and here is the important part), the last pug is missing.  The Joffrey pug is not included because <em>partition</em> will not include items that do not make a complete partition.  In this case, because there is no group of 2 pugs for the Joffrey pug to be in, it gets dropped.</p>

<p><em>This is the thing that has bitten me in the past.</em></p>

<p>A common use for wanting to partition things is to control the number
of things that you process at one time.  An example of this is sending only 500 items to be processed in a batch job at one time.  If you have a few thousand items to be processed, partitioning them is a good way of chuncking.  However, if you have an arbitrary number of items, you most certainly want to process them <em>all</em> and not drop any.  This is where you should use <em>partition-all</em> instead.</p>

<p><a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/partition-all">Partition-all</a> chunks the items as well, but also includes any leftovers.  Demonstrating again with pugs.</p>

<p><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7427/15757758884_20bfd014eb_c.jpg"></p>

<p>This <em>partition-all</em> will give you three groups of pugs.</p>

<p><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7323/16193980179_229343f7f3_c.jpg"></p>

<p>This time pug Joffrey is not left out!</p>

<p>Remember, think carefully before using <em>partition</em>.  Don&rsquo;t leave a pug out.</p>

<p>By the way, I can&rsquo;t wait till the next season of Game of Thrones.  Until then ..</p>

<div class="video-info" >Game of Thrones series 4 is out now on blinkbox: http://blinkbox.me/SVbSdH

To celebrate the release of the fourth series of Game of Thrones on blinkbox we created this video starring 3 adorable pugs. &#8216;The Pugs of Westeros&#8217; sees Roxy, Blue and Bono playing doggy versions of the main characters; including Joffrey Baratheon, Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow. 

The pugs&#8217; owners, Phillip Lauer and his wife Sue, have been dressing their pugs up as characters from movies and TV since they were puppies. They normally only shoot still photography but jumped at the chance of creating a mini-movie based on one of their favourite shows. 

Game of Thrones seasons 1-4 are available to buy on blinkbox now priced at £16.99 in SD and £23.99 in HD. We are also giving 1,000 extra Clubcard points with every purchase of the fourth series plus a free Tesco finest 10&#8221; pizza.</div>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Clojure FizzBuzz without Conditionals]]></title>
    <link href="http://gigasquid.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/clojure-fizzbuzz-without-conditionals/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-13T21:43:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://gigasquid.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/clojure-fizzbuzz-without-conditionals</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4136/4825113119_9630b7927f.jpg"></p>

<p>Sure you may have done FizzBuzz before.  Maybe you have even done it
in Clojure.  But have you done it without the use of <em>any</em>
conditionals?</p>

<p>As your brain starts to work on the <em>how</em> this we be done, you might
be wondering <em>why</em> you should do this in the first place?</p>

<p>There are two very good reasons for this.  The first is that it is a
<em>kata</em>.</p>

<h2>Katas build your code practice</h2>

<p><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/4/3552/3434757877_711709da58_b.jpg"></p>

<p>Code katas build your skill through practice.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter if
you are a beginner or an expert.  Just, like in all those martial arts
movies with the swordsman practicing, so must we.  We stretch and
flex our coding muscles with katas to grow them and keep them in shape.</p>

<p>Yes, you may code every day at work.  But it is not the same as kata
practice.  So much of <em>day to day</em> work involves complexity
with large interconnected concerns.  Our  kata practice cuts the extra
complexity out and leaves you alone with a focused small problem.</p>

<p>The second reason involves why you
should try it, this time,  <em>without conditionals</em>.  The answer is <em>creativity</em>.</p>

<h2>Constraints build creativity.</h2>

<p>It turns out that constraints are a
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/groupthink/2013/07/12/creativity-how-constraints-drive-genius/">key way to drive creativity</a>.
Programming does not only require technical skills, but also
creativity. We are seldom asked to build software without constraints.
It drives design.  Sure, it can be annoying when we have to communicate with
a server that is only active on Tuesday and emits its response in
Morse Code.  But it gives us boundaries to unleash our creative
spirit.</p>

<p>So go for it.</p>

<h2>Give it a try</h2>

<p>Ready?  Here are the details.</p>

<ul>
<li>Given a number, if it number is divisible by 3 return &ldquo;fizz&rdquo;.</li>
<li>If it is divisible by 5 return &ldquo;buzz&rdquo;.</li>
<li>If it is divisible by 3 and 5 return &ldquo;fizzbuzz&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Otherwise, just return the number.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use any conditionals like <em>if</em> <em>else</em> <em>case</em> <em>cond</em>.</li>
</ul>


<p>When you are done, you can check out some of the other solutions. Try
not to peek until you have done your version first though.</p>

<p>(There are some really awesome ones so far).</p>

    <link href="http://gigasquid.github.io/blog/2014/10/31/notes-and-tips-on-working-from-home/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-31T08:16:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://gigasquid.github.io/blog/2014/10/31/notes-and-tips-on-working-from-home</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7538/15671394561_261bf74b95.jpg"></p>

<p>Recently, I switched from a traditional, &ldquo;go to an office&rdquo;
job,
to working from my home.  It took some time to setup my home
work space and get used to working remotely, but I finally have a
system working for me.  In this post, I thought I would share some things that I
found useful.</p>

<h3>Window Seat Please</h3>

<p>If at all possible, locate your home work space near a window.  The
natural light does wonders for you mood and being able to glance up
and look at trees and real life is a refreshing break from staring at
code all day.</p>

<h3>A Door is Great</h3>

<p>Having a door to your workspace is a real advantage.  It enables you
to close off noise and other activity that might be going on in the
house. It is also <em>incredibly</em> useful if you have small children.  For
my kids, if the door is closed, then it is a sign that Mommy is
working &ndash; do not disturb.</p>

<h3>Invest in a good chair.</h3>

<p>Backs are very important.  I started working from home with just my
kitchen chair &ndash; big mistake.  After a day or two, my back was crying
out for something better. I did some research on good chairs to get
and I ended up with a <a href="http://store.steelcase.com/brochures/leap/">Steelcase Leap Chair</a>.  They are not cheap.
But, I was able to get a refurb one that was considerably less than
new, and my back loves it.</p>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t Sit All the Time</h3>

<p>Even with my great chair, it is not the best to sit constantly.  I had
tried a straight standing desk a while back and I found that standing
<em>all</em> the time was not the best for me.  I prefer to mix it up.  I got
a adjustable <a href="http://www.geekdesk.com/">Geek Desk</a>.  I generally stand
up in the morning and sit in the afternoons.</p>

<h3>Freedom from a Headset with a Good Mic</h3>

<p>I have used a headset before when doing remote calls.  They work fine,
but after a while, I found it annoying to have on my head all day.
I switched to a <a href="http://www.bluemic.com/snowball/">Blue Snowball Mic</a>
at home and am really happy with it.  My voice comes in clear and I am
headset free.</p>

<h3>Dual Monitors for the Win</h3>

<p>I use two Thunderbolt displays.  One monitor I use for communications,
it has my email, chat, and video on it.  The other monitor I use for
the codez.  It works out pretty well to switch back and forth.</p>

<h3>Good Software for Communication</h3>

<p>Good communication is a must for working remotely. Someone cannot just
wander over to your desk and ask you a question.  Here is a list of
communication tools I use at work:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> &ndash; for team communication.</li>
<li>Google Docs</li>
<li><a href="http://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> &ndash; for video and screen sharing.  It is way
better than Google hangouts in terms of video quality.</li>
<li>Apple&rsquo;s Screen sharing &ndash; for pair code development.  This let&rsquo;s
people use whatever editor they are comfortable with, yet you can
see the code and still share control.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Pair Programming is Awesome</h3>

<p>At work, we do pair programming most of the time.  I really like to
work this way.  One of the things that I was concerned about in
switching to remote work was being lonely. Pair programming really
helps in this.  I am usually working with someone during
the day, with one monitor going with video and voice, while the other
monitor has the code we are working on.  For me, it has all the advantages of
idea sharing and group problem solving.  I realize that working this
way is not for everyone, but I am digging it.</p>

<h3>Routine is Everything</h3>

<p>When working for home, I have found it is crucial to have a good
routine.  Since we do a lot of pair programming at work, we all
generally keep the same hours.  Being a distributed team over North
America, this means I start work at around 10am EST.  I have found
that having a routine a sticking to it helps structure my day.  I get
up, get dressed, eat breakfast, just like I was going to work.  Then, I
usually hack for a bit on personal stuff in the morning until it is
time for work.  Then at lunch, I go for a run or work out.  Finally,
and most importantly, in the evening, I leave the computer behind and
devote time to family.</p>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t Forget to Visit with Other Humans</h3>

<p>The downside of working from home is that it is very easy to <em>not</em>
leave home.  At one point, I realized that I had not left the house
for a week.  Not good. I try go to a social event where I will
meet with other developers and friends every week.  There is a nice
developer <a href="https://teamgaslight.com/coffee">coffee group</a> that meets on Fridays.  I also help run our
<a href="https://cincyfp.wordpress.com/">Cincinnati Functional Programmer&rsquo;s
Group</a> here in town.  In general,
I find that if I am driving somewhere and see people walking on the
street and start thinking, &ldquo;Look Humans!&rdquo;, it is time to get out and
socialize a bit more.  Working remotely, makes going to conferences
and being with other developers in person even more fun.</p>

<h3>Summary (with a Dog Pic)</h3>

<p>I have found working remotely to be quite enjoyable so far.  It does
take an extra effort to keep your life structured and communication
flowing properly, but it is worth it.</p>

<p>My next challenge, since it is getting colder, is to get my dog
to sleep on my feet while I work.  No luck so far.</p>

<p>If anyone has
any tips, let me know.</p>

</span><span class='line'>   <span class="s">&quot;anywhere&quot;</span><span class="p">])</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, let&rsquo;s create a function that will transform the places into a &ldquo;I would not eat them &hellip;&rdquo; sentence.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">i-do-not-like-them</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">s</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">format</span> <span class="s">&quot;I would not eat them %s.&quot;</span> <span class="nv">s</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">i-do-not-like-them</span> <span class="s">&quot;in the rain&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;; -&gt; &quot;I would not eat them in the rain.&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We also need a function to take this result and actually try the green eggs and ham.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">try-them</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">s</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">clojure.string/replace</span> <span class="nv">s</span>  <span class="o">#</span><span class="s">&quot; not&quot;</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">try-them</span> <span class="s">&quot;I would not eat them in the rain.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;; -&gt; &quot;I would eat them in the rain.&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we have two transformations that we can apply to the vector of green-eggs-n-ham strings.
One of the really nice things about transducers is that you can describe and compose this transformation without a data structure present.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">sam-i-am-xform</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">comp</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">map </span><span class="nv">i-do-not-like-them</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">map </span><span class="nv">try-them</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We can run the transformation of the transducers against the data in a few ways.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>into</em>: Non-lazy turn the transformation into a collection</li>
<li><em>sequence</em>: Same thing but lazy</li>
<li><em>transduce</em>: Acts like reduce on the all the transformed elements</li>
<li>With <em>core.async</em> channels doing the transformations.</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the green eggs and ham example for each one of these ways:</p>

<h3>Into</h3>

<p>Into takes a transducer and collection to work on and returns the vector we asked for:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">into </span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="nv">sam-i-am-xform</span> <span class="nv">green-eggs-n-ham</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;; -&gt; [&quot;I would eat them in the rain.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     &quot;I would eat them on a train.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     &quot;I would eat them in a box.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     &quot;I would eat them with a fox.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     &quot;I would eat them in a house.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     &quot;I would eat them with a mouse.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     &quot;I would eat them here or there.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     &quot;I would eat them anywhere.&quot;]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Sequence</h3>

<p>Sequence takes similar arguments, but as promised, returns a lazy sequence that we can interact with.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">class </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">sequence</span> <span class="nv">sam-i-am-xform</span> <span class="nv">green-eggs-n-ham</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;; -&gt; clojure.lang.LazyTransformer</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">take </span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">sequence</span> <span class="nv">sam-i-am-xform</span> <span class="nv">green-eggs-n-ham</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;; -&gt; (&quot;I would eat them in the rain.&quot;)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Transduce</h3>

<p>If we want to finally arrange all our sentences in the vectors into one string, we would use reduce.  The way to do this with transducers is to use <em>transduce</em>.  It takes a function of two arguments to perform the reduce, as well as an initial data input.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">transduce</span> <span class="nv">sam-i-am-xform</span> <span class="o">#</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">str </span><span class="nv">%1</span> <span class="nv">%2</span> <span class="s">&quot; &quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class="nv">green-eggs-n-ham</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;; -&gt; &quot;I would eat them in the rain.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     I would eat them on a train.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     I would eat them in a box.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     I would eat them with a fox.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     I would eat them in a house.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     I would eat them with a mouse.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     I would eat them here or there.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     I would eat them anywhere.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;_note: In  1.7.0-alpha2, transduce changed and you need to use a</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;(transduce sam-i-am-xform (completing #(str %1 %2 &quot; &quot;)) &quot;&quot; green-eggs-n-ham)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;instead.</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Core.async</h3>

<p>Core.async has a really nice way to define channels with a transducer that will transform each element on the channel.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">sam-i-am-chan</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">async/chan</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="nv">sam-i-am-xform</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Let&rsquo;s define another channel to reduce the results of the sam-i-am-chan to a string.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">result-chan</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">async/reduce</span> <span class="o">#</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">str </span><span class="nv">%1</span> <span class="nv">%2</span> <span class="s">&quot; &quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class="nv">sam-i-am-chan</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s actually put the green-eggs-n-ham data onto the sam-i-am-chan and let the data transformations flow&hellip;.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">async/onto-chan</span> <span class="nv">sam-i-am-chan</span> <span class="nv">green-eggs-n-ham</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At last,
we can get our result off the result channel and revel in the beauty of asynchronous data transducers.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">i-like-them</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">async/&lt;!!</span> <span class="nv">result-chan</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">i-like-them</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;; -&gt; &quot;I would eat them in the rain.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     I would eat them on a train.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     I would eat them in a box.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     I would eat them with a fox.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     I would eat them in a house.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     I would eat them with a mouse.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     I would eat them here or there.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;     I would eat them anywhere.&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Transducers are elegant and powerful, just like the rest of Clojure.  Try them, you will like them :)</p>

    <link href="http://gigasquid.github.io/blog/2014/07/28/the-proper-pronunciation-of-clojures-assoc/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-28T20:27:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://gigasquid.github.io/blog/2014/07/28/the-proper-pronunciation-of-clojures-assoc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I pause before talking to someone about Clojure code. Not because I am unsure of the code, but because I am unsure of
how to pronounce the code.  The particular code in question is
Clojure&rsquo;s <em>assoc</em>.  I have heard it pronounced two ways. One is
&ldquo;assosh&rdquo;, the other is &ldquo;assok&rdquo;.  So, to determine it, I decided to conduct a
scientific poll of the Clojure community.</p>

<p>I posted the poll on
<a href="https://twitter.com/gigasquid/status/493891057906896896">twitter</a> to
the Cojure community who follow me.  The control group poll was not viewed
by those who do not follow me, and/or, are not on twitter.</p>

<p>The results were startling.</p>

<p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2928/14585605540_6d0ce6169f_n.jpg"></p>

<ul>
<li>assosh &ndash; 10</li>
<li>assok  &ndash; 8</li>
<li>assose &ndash; 2</li>
<li>Jeremy &ndash; 1</li>
<li>asoaksh &ndash; 1</li>
</ul>


<p>The community is clearly deeply divided on this important question.</p>

<p>After sifting through the raw data, I remembered my statistical analysis and threw out the extremes.</p>

<p><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5559/14792182503_12aa682260_n.jpg"></p>

<p>The conclusion was still a stark reality.</p>

<p><em>We do not as a community know how to pronounce assoc.</em></p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>I can only see one way forward.  We must address this as a community.
I propose that the community documentation of <a href="http://clojuredocs.org/">Clojure Docs</a>
and <a href="http://grimoire.arrdem.com/">Grimoire</a> modify their sites to include audio pronunciation like <a href="http://www.macmillandictionary.com/us/media/british/uk_pron/l/lla/llama/llama_British_English_pronunciation.mp3">this</a>.</p>

<p>Remember, I&rsquo;m pulling for you.  We are all in this together.</p>

    <link href="http://gigasquid.github.io/blog/2014/07/27/clojure-x-men/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-27T20:12:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://gigasquid.github.io/blog/2014/07/27/clojure-x-men</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5557/14761955842_6a8bf4a66a_n.jpg"></p>

<p>Nobody knows how it happened.  Some people think it was due to the rapid expansion and adoption of Clojure.  Other people say that the language itself was caused by something deeper and more magical.  No one knows for sure.  All that we really know is that people starting being born with extraordinary powers.  Powers that no human had had before.  They were strange and unique to each person they touched.  The only thing that they all had in common, was that each was an aspect of the Clojure programming language.</p>

<h2>Luke (AKA Lazy Luke)</h2>

<p>Luke was a teenager when his powers came to him.  His mother always complained that he was lazy.  It was true, he did prefer to sleep until noon.  He also had a habit of putting everything off to the last minute, like saving all his papers for the night before they were due.  One day, though, he noticed something very strange.  He could start to see the future.  Well not really “see” it.  But he could see the infinite possibilities  of the future.  Not very far into the future, but enough.  It was a few milliseconds at first.  But now it was up to a full second.  He checked the Clojure Docs as soon as he realized his gift.  It was lazy evaluation and power to deal with infinite sequences.</p>

<h2>Spress</h2>

<p>Spress, whose real name is Emily, came into her power early.  She was
only 5 years old.  Her mother had taken her to a farm to visit with
the animals.  Her mother had pointed at the cow and told her daughter
that it said “Moo”.  Then, at the horse, saying “Neigh”.  Spress
smiled and  pointed at a bucket and said “cow”.  Her mother shook her head at her, but Spress only smiled bigger.  She said “cow” again.  Then, suddenly, the bucket went “Moo”.  She was immediately taken to the Clojure X-Men school, where they identified her power as protocols.  She trained her power and now is so good at solving the “expression problem”, she is known as “Spress”.</p>

<h2>Multi</h2>

<p>Nobody knows Multi’s background.  He came to notice in his early twenties with his powers.  Ordinary humans process sensory input, (like sight, touch, and sound), in an asynchronous fashion.  However, when it gets processed in the brain, it runs into a single pipeline bottleneck  &ndash; consciousness.  Multi’s power is that he can concurrently process his higher level consciousness and reasoning to all this sensory input.  The result is that he can move, think, and perform super fast  and in a super smart way.
He got the power of Clojure’s concurrency.</p>

<h2>Dot</h2>

<p>Dot always had a way with animals.  She had many pets growing up.  Later, she would go into the forest and the animals would seek her out.  She would be found resting by a tree surrounded by deer and birds.  One time, on her walk, she fell down a ditch and had her leg trapped under a log.  Her mother arrived, after searching for her, to see a Bear reach down and gently remove the log.   She stood dumbfounded, as her daughter thanked the bear and it nodded in reply as it turned away.   She could talk with animals effortlessly.  She had the power of Clojure’s Interop.</p>

<h2>Bob</h2>

<p>Bob is the leader of the Clojure X-Men.  He seeks out people with the
power of Clojure and helps train and educate them.  He also is the
most powerful.  He can come into any argument, problem, or challenge
and immediately separate out what is most important to focus on.  He
always knows the right thing to do, without getting bogged down in
unnecessary details .  His power is Clojure’s simplicity.</p>

<p>There might be others out there, we don’t know.  We can only hope, that they are found by Bob and the Clojure X-Men and use their powers for good.</p>

    <id>http://gigasquid.github.io/blog/2014/07/06/love-songs-through-history-and-why-you-should-create</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/02/lovesong.gif"></p>

<h2>The Earliest Known Love Song</h2>

<p>The earliest known love song was found in an <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/02/0213_1stlovesong.html">Egyptian tomb</a>.  The
fragment found in the 4,300 year old tomb read:</p>

<pre><code>I love and admire your beauty. I am under it.
</code></pre>

<h2>Medieval Love Songs</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.luminarium.org/medlit/manasseh.jpg"></p>

<p>Moving forward in history to Medieval times, there are many examples
of love songs. One of them from a great composer in the 14th century,
named <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/love-in-the-arts/medieval.html">Guillaume de Machaut</a>:, went something like
this:</p>

<pre><code>You are the true sapphire
that can heal and end all my sufferings,
the emerald which brings rejoicing,
the ruby to brighten and comfort the heart.
</code></pre>

<h2>Love Songs from this Summer</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8d/Coldplay_-_A_Sky_Full_of_Stars_%28Single%29.png"></p>

<p>Love songs abound on the radio and internet today. One was
released by Coldplay recently, called &ldquo;A Sky Full of Stars&rdquo;.
The lyrics go something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Cause you're a sky
Cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm going to give you my heart
Cause you're a sky
Cause you're a sky full of stars
And cause you light up the path
</code></pre>

<h2>Why Create?</h2>

<h3>I have nothing to say that has not been said</h3>

<p>These are the whispering excuses that I hear in the back of my head when
I sit down at a blank text editor:</p>

<ul>
<li>Someone has already said this.</li>
<li>Someone has already built this algorithm.</li>
<li>Someone has already built this library.</li>
<li>I have nothing to say that has not been said before.</li>
</ul>


<h3>But it has not been said by you.</h3>

<p>Love is a universal human emotion.  We have evidence that people have
been writing about it and singing about it for at least 4,000 years.</p>

<p>Hasn&rsquo;t everything already been said about it?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>We still want to hear it again.  We still want to hear it new, said by
another. It means something slightly different, feels different
when said again by someone else with different experiences, from a
different life, from a different perspective..</p>

<p>The same goes for your writing, your code, your library, and your creation.</p>

<p>So open up your favorite editor and brush aside your fears. It is a
blank canvas, ready for your thoughts and code.</p>

<p>Say it loud</p>

<p>Say it strong</p>

<p>Create</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry if it has been said before</p>

<p>It is new because it is said by you</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while ago, I was <a href="http://gigasquidsoftware.com/blog/2013/05/01/growing-a-language-with-haskell-and-instaparse/">exploring creating a programming language with
Instaparse</a>.
I ended up exploring some concepts of Speech Acts proposed by John
McCarthy by creating my first toy language called
<a href="http://gigasquidsoftware.com/blog/2013/06/04/babar-a-little-language-with-speech-acts-for-machines/">Babar</a>.
Shortly after posting a blog about it, I got an email from someone
saying that I might be interested in a full blown, real programming
language that also incorporated Speech Acts.  I happily started
composing an reply to the email that started off with</p>

<pre><code>That is so cool! ...
</code></pre>

<p>Then I realized that the author of the email and language was none
other than
Frank McCabe,
one of the designers of the
<a href="http://bit.ly/1pJtG0x">Go! programming language</a>
(not to be confused with Google Go).  My brain froze
while it was thinking</p>

<pre><code>"OMG!!!! Frank McCabe, a real language designer, just emailed me!".
</code></pre>

<p>This unfortunately, made the rest of my email reply sound something like
this</p>

<pre><code>Frank,
That is so cool!  herp derp derp Speech Acts herp derp John
McCarthy derp...
</code></pre>

<p>His programming language is the Star
Programming Language.  It was originally developed for use at a company that he
worked at called Starview.  It has since been open sourced and moved
to <a href="https://github.com/fmccabe/star">git</a>.  I finally had a bit a
spare time and I had been itching to give
Star a look.  To my pleasant surprise, despite my initial fumbling
email impression,  Frank was open a friendly to
get me started in it.
I have only scratched the surface in exploring the language, but I
wanted to share my initial impressions, as well as point you to some
<a href="https://github.com/gigasquid/star-lang-katas">beginner katas</a> that I
put together, so that you could join in the fun.</p>

<h2>Crash Overview</h2>

<p>Star is a strongly typed, functional language. It is not a pure
functional language because is allows assignment and stateful objects,
but the language is designed in a way that immutable functional
programming is encouraged. The feel of the language is concise but
human readable.</p>

<blockquote><p>Star is a coherent, general-purpose programming language that<br/>    combines elements from a wide variety of existing languages as<br/>    well as adding innovative elements of its own. Star inherits func-<br/>    tional programming in general, a Haskell-style type system, an F#-<br/>    style monad for parallel computations, and Concurrent ML for or-<br/>    chestrating concurrent and parallel applications.</p><footer><strong>Feel different on the Java platform: the star programming language</strong> <cite><a href='http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2500837&dl=ACM&coll=DL&CFID=354902651&CFTOKEN=90319052'>dl.acm.org/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<h3>Hello World</h3>

<p>The best way to get a feel for it is to look at a few examples.  Of
course, let&rsquo;s start off with Hello World.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">main</span><span class="nb">()</span> <span class="kr">do</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">logMsg</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">info</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Hello World&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Another way of doing our Hello World is in a worksheet.
This feature is still in the works, but it will likely turn into a
replacement for a REPL, being integrated into the editor.  The import
statement will also soon not be required.  But a nice feature of using
the worksheeet is that is a combined module and transcript of the
session.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">import</span> <span class="nn">worksheet</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">worksheet</span><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">show</span> <span class="s">&quot;hello world&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here is what the output looks like:</p>

<pre><code>Jun 11, 2014 11:21:09 AM  
INFO: "hello world" -&gt; "hello world" at 4
info: execution took 0.053684428
</code></pre>

<h3>Pattern Matching</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at another example.  This time a naive fib function
with pattern matching.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">import</span> <span class="nn">worksheet</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">worksheet</span><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">assert</span> <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">assert</span> <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">assert</span> <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">assert</span> <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="mi">55</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Notice how the fib function is defined with pattern matching.  Also
how the keyword &ldquo;is&rdquo; is used instead of an &ldquo;=&rdquo; to make the code flow
more readable (IMO).</p>

<p>The output of running the program is:</p>

<pre><code>Jun 11, 2014 3:32:38 PM  
INFO: fib(0) = 0 ok at 9
Jun 11, 2014 3:32:38 PM  
INFO: fib(1) = 1 ok at 10
Jun 11, 2014 3:32:38 PM  
INFO: fib(3) = 2 ok at 11
Jun 11, 2014 3:32:38 PM  
INFO: fib(10) = 55 ok at 12
info: execution took 0.039725132
</code></pre>

<h3>Pattern Matching with Guards</h3>

<p>The declaration of pattern matching for functions can also include
guards like in this fizzbuzz example</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">fizzbuzz</span> <span class="n">has</span> <span class="kr">type</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">integer</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">string</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">fizzbuzz</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">N</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="kr">where</span> <span class="kt">N</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="n">and</span> <span class="kt">N</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="s">&quot;fizzbuzz&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">fizzbuzz</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">N</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="kr">where</span> <span class="kt">N</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="s">&quot;fizz&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">fizzbuzz</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">N</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="kr">where</span> <span class="kt">N</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="s">&quot;buzz&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">fizzbuzz</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">N</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="kr">default</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="s">&quot;$N&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Also note the type declaration.  The type declaration is optional.
The complier is smart enough to figure it out.  Sometimes it is more
readable to include the type declaration.  But, it can be left out for
more concise code.</p>

<h3>Cons Lists</h3>

<p>One of the important collection types are cons lists. These are lists
that you add to the front of and are destructed as the first element
and then the rest of the list. To construct a cons list:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'> <span class="n">testNumbers</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">cons</span> <span class="kr">of</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">13</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">14</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To use a cons list in a function with pattern matching:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">listFizzBuzz</span> <span class="n">has</span> <span class="kr">type</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cons</span> <span class="kr">of</span> <span class="n">integer</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">cons</span> <span class="kr">of</span> <span class="n">string</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">listFizzBuzz</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">nil</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">nil</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">listFizzBuzz</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cons</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">cons</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fizzbuzz</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">listFizzBuzz</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The function listFizzBuzz takes in a list of integers and turns it
into a list of strings using the fizzbuzz function. If we evaluate:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">testNumbers</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">cons</span> <span class="kr">of</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">13</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">14</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">result</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">listFizzBuzz</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">testNumbers</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The result will look like</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">cons</span> <span class="kr">of</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">&quot;1&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;2&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;fizz&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;4&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;buzz&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;fizz&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;7&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;8&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;fizz&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;buzz&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;11&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;fizz&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;13&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;14&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="s">&quot;fizzbuzz&quot;</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There are other collection types such as arrays and relations, (which
are really cool &ndash; you can do queries on them like a database), but I haven&rsquo;t explored them well enough to really
talk about yet.</p>

<h3>Actors and Speech Acts</h3>

<p>Star has actors that use three Speech Acts: Notify, Request, and
Query.  The actors themselves can also be concurrent. I explored the
Speech Act/ Actor model with an example from John McCarthy&rsquo;s
<a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/elephant/elephant.html">Elephant 2000 paper</a>,
which is a Airline Reservation system.</p>

<p>To use the notify speech act, you need to define what type the
notifications are on the actors channel.  In my case, the
notifications are either going to be a book(string) method, or a
cancel(string) method.  To book a reservation for a person or cancel
it.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>There is some extra things in the code, but for right now, look at the
book and cancel methods.  These are the functions that will be called
when the actor is notified like this:</p>

<h2>Go Explore</h2>

<p>I have only scratched the surface of the language, but I have had a
great time.  I invite you to come take a look.</p>

<p>Warning.  Only the brave need apply.  There is no StackOverflow.
There is no user group or IRC channel yet.  These are green fields to
be discovered in the Open Source world.  If it appeals to you as much
as me, jump on in.  Here are a few resources to get you going:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/gigasquid/star-lang-katas">Star-Lang Katas</a>:
Clone the repo or fork the repos.  It has a shell script
to compile and run the star programs.  It also has a emacs mode
plugin and a reference pdf. The most important part is that it has a
template of katas ready for your to solve.  Your challenge:
uncomment the assertion and make the code pass.  My solutions are in
the solutions branch when you are done.  If you finish all of them
and want more, consider creating some and submitting a pull request :)</p></li>
<li><p>I mentioned it earlier, but there is a great overview paper on the
language itself
<a href="http://www.deinprogramm.de/sperber/papers/star.pdf">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, here is the repo of the Star Language itself
<a href="https://github.com/fmccabe/star">https://github.com/fmccabe/star</a>.
Checkout out the tests.  There are tons of sample star programs
that cover the language&rsquo;s features.</p></li>

    <updated>2014-03-20T21:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://gigasquid.github.io/blog/2014/03/20/world-domination-with-hexapods-and-clojure</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Once you have your <a href="http://gigasquidsoftware.com/blog/2014/03/19/walking-with-hexapods/">hexapod assembled and running using the hand held
controller</a>,
of course, your thoughts naturally turn to world domination.</p>

<h2>The most powerful tool in the world is the Clojure REPL</h2>

<p>World domination requires the most powerful tools available.  That of
course calls for Clojure and the Clojure REPL.  I recommend Emacs
as the editor of choice of such an endeavor.  However, it if you are
content with city, state, or single country domination, other editors
that support Clojure are also fine.</p>

<h2>Connect the XBee to your computer</h2>

<p>First, we need to get the computer to talk to the hexapod wirelessly.
We can do this with a <a href="http://www.trossenrobotics.com/uartsbee">USB to Serial adapter</a>
that uses the paired XBee from the handheld commander.</p>

<p>Take the XBee from the handheld commander</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3698/13278059985_f5b5c01819_n.jpg"></p>

<p>and move it to the USB to serial adapter</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7067/13298779543_f69a14b42c_n.jpg"></p>

<p>Now plug the usb into your computer.</p>

<h2>Get your Clojure ready</h2>

<p>In your clojure project, the only magic you need is the <a href="https://github.com/samaaron/serial-port">Serial Port library</a>. Import the library and list your serial ports.  Then open the one that shows up for you.</p>

<p>Since we are going to be talking to the hexapod.  We need to send the commands in the same format that it is expecting. Basically, a packet of where the postions of the joystick are, as well as what buttons are pushed.</p>

<p>If you want to see the code, it is out on github as <a href="https://github.com/gigasquid/clj-hexapod">clj-hexapod</a>.  Please keep in mind that it is early days still, and I am still just exploring.</p>

<h2>Phoneix Code Firmware</h2>

<p>It is worth noting the the above code was meant to run with the default hexapod firmware.  That is the &ldquo;Nuke&rdquo; firmware.  There is another firmware, the <a href="https://github.com/KurtE/Arduino_Phoenix_Parts">Phoenix code</a>, that gives the hexapod more lifelike moves and allows it to twist and shift is rather creepy ways.</p>

<p>I just loaded it on the hexapod yesterday.  The commander software changed too, so I will of course need to revisit the code, to add in the new moves.  But here is a sneak preview of what it can do:</p>

<div class="ratio-4-3 embed-video-container" onclick="var myAnchor = document.getElementById('PmBGt9T-yvI');var tmpDiv = document.createElement('div');tmpDiv.innerHTML = '&lt;iframe style=&quot;vertical-align:top;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/PmBGt9T-yvI?autoplay=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;';myAnchor.parentNode.replaceChild(tmpDiv.firstChild, myAnchor);return false;" title="click here to play">

<p><em>That is my daughter singing in the background</em></p>

<h2>That&rsquo;s all for now</h2>

<p>I hope I have given you pointers for getting started on your own world domination with Clojure and Hexapods. Remember to practice your laugh &hellip;. Muhahaha :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3804/13278398783_0bedfa7b40.jpg"></p>

<p>Here we see the <a href="http://www.trossenrobotics.com/phantomx-ax-hexapod.aspx">PhantomX Hexapod</a> thriving in the natural habitat of a
cozy, climate controlled, modern house. But there was a time before
the hexapod.  In particular, there was a time of many hexapod parts
and a high level software developer that somehow, despite her natural
lack of mechanical skills, managed to bring it to life. This blog post
endeavors to chronicle the high and low points of this journey. And
perhaps, will make it easier for any other brave souls that would like
to bring the <em>Age of Hexapods</em> into their homes.</p>

<h2>Oh My! So Many Parts</h2>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t really mentally prepared for the vast amounts of parts in the
kit.  Here is a sampling:</p>

<ul>
<li>18 AX-12A Servos</li>
<li>Top/ Bottom Body Plate</li>
<li>20 Brackets</li>
<li>Arbotix Board</li>
<li>2 Xbees</li>
<li>Lipo Battery &amp; Charger</li>
<li>Arbotix programmer</li>
<li>19 Cables</li>
<li><strong>50,000 nuts and screws </strong> (Really only about 850 &ndash; but you get my
 point)</li>
</ul>


<h2>First Things First</h2>

<p>The very first thing to do is to make sure that you have all the
parts.  Once I went through the checklist and double counted all my
screws, I was relieved to go onto the next task of programming the
Arbotix and assign ids to servos and center them. These steps
consisted of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Getting the Arduino IDE going</li>
<li>Loading the Drivers and Libraries</li>
<li>Loading the ROS (Robot Operating System) on the Arbotix Board, so
that it could be used to program the servos.</li>
</ul>


<p>Each of the servos have to be assigned a number. This will let the
program know which part of the leg is which, so that it will
eventually &ndash; hopefully, be able to walk. Once the id is given, a
sticker is labeled on the servo for future use. Centering the servos
is a VERY important step not to overlook.  If you do not center the
servos, you will get into the unfortunate circumstance of having to
dissemble the robot, cry, recenter the servos, and then reassemble the
robot. Please avoid.</p>

<h2>Putting It Together</h2>

<p>The assembly starts with the feet and legs first.
I was so pleased when I got the feet assembled, that I considered
knitting little baby hexapod booties.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7298/13278059445_562bb9ce4b.jpg"></p>

<p>Next a servo and the tibia is added</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7311/13278197583_599f030bab.jpg"></p>

<p>Another servo and the tibia and femur is assembled</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7185/13278392294_8986c14e5b.jpg"></p>

<p>Finally, another servo and the whole leg is assembled</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7033/13278197683_cfd9a4870f.jpg"></p>

<h2>Newbie Advice</h2>

<p>I would like to pause for a minute to share some advice from my trial
and errors in assembly thus far:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t overtighten screws </strong> &ndash; More is not better. It makes things
like plexiglass frames crack and break.</li>
<li><strong>Seating nuts in servos is hard</strong> &ndash; This isn&rsquo;t really advice. Just
moral support in your struggle.  There are 18 servos and up to 20
nuts to seat in each servo.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3833/13278059175_91699a9704_n.jpg"></p>

<h2>Assembling the body</h2>

<p>The body is where the board, battery and and cables go.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3755/13278197953_44717aea96.jpg"></p>

<p>At long last, the legs can be attached to the body &ndash; with 120 screws
of course.</p>

<h2>Round two of Newbie Advice</h2>

<ul>
<li>For those who have never stripped wires and attached them to power
supplies, like me, please mind that the wires are twisted so that
the edges don&rsquo;t fray out and short out everything requiring you to
re-assign all the servos that lost their ids and much unscrewing,
crying, and reassembling.</li>
<li>When programming the Arbotix board.  You must remove the Xbee, or it
will not work.</li>
<li>Also, did I mention not over-tightening screws? Also, the order in
which you tighten the screws is important too.  Try to tighten them
all loosely in order, so you don&rsquo;t stress the fiberglass parts and
have something like this happen.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3749/13278392754_cde8d9e10f_n.jpg"></p>

<h2>It is Alive!</h2>

<p>Finally, the moment of truth. The hexapod is assembled and it is time
to upload a test check on the board to make sure that everything is
working alright.</p>

<div class="ratio-4-3 embed-video-container" onclick="var myAnchor = document.getElementById('i9St8kDuyqU');var tmpDiv = document.createElement('div');tmpDiv.innerHTML = '&lt;iframe style=&quot;vertical-align:top;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/i9St8kDuyqU?autoplay=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;';myAnchor.parentNode.replaceChild(tmpDiv.firstChild, myAnchor);return false;" title="click here to play">

<div class="youtube-lazy-link-info">Hexapod Test Check</div>
</a>
<div class="video-info" >It lives - the first test check of the PhantomX Hexapod</div>
</div>


<h2>Walking with Hexapods</h2>

<p>The kit comes with a commander that you assemble of course.  You can
use it to control the hexapod with hand-held joysticks.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3698/13278059985_f5b5c01819_n.jpg"></p>

<p>The moment of truth, when it finally took its very first steps, and the Age of Hexapods began.</p>

<div class="ratio-4-3 embed-video-container" onclick="var myAnchor = document.getElementById('pUrZeJ39xjs');var tmpDiv = document.createElement('div');tmpDiv.innerHTML = '&lt;iframe style=&quot;vertical-align:top;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/pUrZeJ39xjs?autoplay=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;';myAnchor.parentNode.replaceChild(tmpDiv.firstChild, myAnchor);return false;" title="click here to play">

    <link href="http://gigasquid.github.io/blog/2014/02/22/remembering-jim/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-22T11:02:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://gigasquid.github.io/blog/2014/02/22/remembering-jim</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://newcontext-production.s3.amazonaws.com/portrait/jim-weirich/medium_78048abb24eadb2017034c5ee10826f9.jpg"></p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t really understand how important someone is in your life
until they are suddenly gone. I have had the honor and privilege of
working, playing, and laughing alongside Jim Weirich for the last few
years.  He was an amazing man.  I miss him dearly.</p>

<h2>Think</h2>

<p>Jim taught us how to think about computer programming. I once had a
Physics professor tell me not to worry so
much about the formulas and math. The most important thing was how to
<strong>think</strong>.
Everything thing after that would
naturally fall into place.  Jim embodied that philosophy for
programming.  The languages and algorithms poured almost
effortlessly from his masterful fingers.  He knew how to <strong>think</strong> about
the problem, observe from a multitude of angles.  Finally, bringing his
experience, creativity, and humility to bear on it, he would shape it into
a beautiful piece of code.</p>

<h2>Make</h2>

<p>Jim showed us how to make. He was a master craftsman and a maker. The
care and joy that infused his work was inspiring.  He loved the
process of Test Driven Development. Green tests were always a
celebration. The surprise of beautiful code emerging from a
refactoring was treated as a gift.  He is best known for his
<a href="https://github.com/jimweirich/rake">Rake</a> build tool, but his testing
library <a href="https://github.com/jimweirich/rspec-given">rspec-given</a> is
one that reminds me most of him and the way that he loved to craft code.</p>

<h2>Care</h2>

<p>Jim showed us how to care.  Jim cared deeply about each and every
person.  While flying his drone in the office hallway, he would wave
down a passing building maintenance worker and ask if they wanted to
fly it.  Over the course of the next few minutes, Jim would put them
completely at ease and chat happily with them.  He was like that to
<strong>everyone</strong>.  In the few days after
his passing, many building workers, and people from other offices, that
I only ever nodded at in passing, stopped by to give their sincere
condolences his loss. He is without a doubt, the kindest person I have
ever known.  He took great joy in his faith and in his family.  He
would talk about his family all the time and how much they enjoyed
each others company.  He is without a doubt, one of the personally richest men I have ever known.</p>

<h2>Share</h2>

<p>Jim taught us how to share. Jim wanted to share his knowledge.  He was
a great teacher and presenter. He gave engaging presentations that
took people on a journey with him, not only imparting knowledge, but
becoming friends with him in the process.  He was a pillar in the local
Cincinnati technical community. He is the reason why myself and
countless others were drawn to Ruby and the Ruby community.</p>

<h2>Dream</h2>

<p>Jim dreamed with us.  He was a creative. He was also a singer, song
writer, musician, and artist.  He brought that creative spirit,
curiosity, and love of learning to the technical world. I will cherish
our lunches spent together flying our AR Drones, sometimes crashing
them into walls and each other, while trying to find creative ways of
controlling them with code.  He was just lately exploring with the
micro-quadcopters like the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Estes-4606-Proto-Quadcopter-Black/dp/B00G924W98">Proto-X</a>.
We had plans to make all our Spheros, Roombas, big drones, and little
drones dance to live coded music. We were both auditing on
<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/ethx/ethx-amrx-autonomous-mobile-robots-1342">Autonomous Mobile Robots</a>
to see what we could learn to help us with our robot dreams.</p>

<p>I miss him dearly.  I will cherish my memories of him and I am so
grateful for all the ways he has enriched my life.  I will remember
that when I dream in code, he is still there with me.</p>

<p>Until that day when we will fly our friendly robots together again.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amy and Frank fled down the stairs from her office and met an
unexpected obstacle to their exit, a locked door.  As
they peered out the window, they saw yesterday&rsquo;s Amy pull up in the
parking space, get out, retrieve her laptop, and start to head in
the front door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh good, we can take your car&rdquo;, said Frank.</p>

<p>Amy took a second to recover from the shock of seeing what her hair really
looked like from behind and then asked, &ldquo;But, how can we get to it?
The door is locked, and we
can&rsquo;t go back up to the office&hellip; I would meet myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank smiled, pulled out the <em>Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to Clojure</em> and
pulled up a page with the heading <em>Locked Doors and Other Small
Bothers</em>.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3346/3191331375_a773bff1b7_n.jpg"></p>

<p><em>One of the reasons for the surprising success of <strong>The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide
to Clojure</strong> is helpful advice of on an assortment of practical
matters.</em></p>

<p><em>Locked doors are a common nuisance in modern times.  Fortunately,
Clojure provides a very handy function for such occasions, <a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/1.2.0/clojure.core/fnil">fnil</a>.
This commonly overlooked function, takes an existing function and
returns a new function that allows you to specify a default
for a nil parameter. For example, take this locked door:</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">locked-door</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">key</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">if </span><span class="nb">key </span><span class="s">&quot;open&quot;</span> <span class="s">&quot;nope - staying shut&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">locked-door</span> <span class="nv">nil</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;=&gt; &quot;nope - staying shut&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>In this case, the simple application of fnil will help remove this
pesky obstacle.</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">this-door</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">fnil</span> <span class="nv">locked-door</span> <span class="ss">:another-key-that-works</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">this-door</span> <span class="ss">:key</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;=&gt; &quot;open&quot;</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Please be advised, that some doors are locked for a good reason. It
is left to the user&rsquo;s discretion. But it is highly recommended in Norway&rsquo;s
moose regions, to think twice.</em></p>

<p>They unlocked the door and headed for Amy&rsquo;s car.  She couldn&rsquo;t decide
whether she was surprised or not to find her keys in her pocket, so
she gave up and just got in instead.  After a short drive, they
arrived at the zoo and navigated their way through various
school groups and arrive at the Aquarium.</p>

<p>Amy at this point, having prided herself on her adaptable nature, was
still having trouble processing the latest events. She had
discovered that Frank was a Datomic time traveller,  the  world was
made of Clojure, and it was also about to be destroyed in a short
future that she just came from.  Her rational brain, (which was
currently working way too hard), was quite
relieved to be distracted by the sight of two really adorable otters.  They were floating
contentedly around the pool, occasionally stopping to crack an Abalone
shell on their fuzzy tummies.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sea-otters.jpg"></p>

<p>Her rational brain, after having a nice breather, finally re-asserted
itself and made Amy ask Frank:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are we here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Otters are the front-line Chrono-guards, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went on to explain that otters are tasked with the important job of
keeping a close watch on human civilization and making critical, minor
adjustments to keep things on an even track.  All those nature videos
of otters cracking shells with rocks?  They are really evaluating
Clojure expressions crucial to our way of life. Most of the time, they
prefer to do their work remote.  They find floating on their backs in
the peaceful waters the most productive work environment.  However,
sometimes they will construct zoos or aquariums, when their work
requires them to keep a closer watch on some areas.  In times of great
need, they might even take a human form for a short while.  Recently,
one of their agents was inadvertently
<a href="https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6003866624/h0B1E03BF/">exposed</a> and
required a few extra Abalone shells to straighten out.</p>

<p>Frank opened his pack and handed his evaluator to Amy to hold
while fished out four mini-marshmallows.  He gave two to Amy and then
proceeded to put one in his ear and the other in his mouth.  More
remarkably still, he appeared to be speaking with the otters.</p>

<p><em>Mini-marshmallows are the best way to create portable Clojure
<a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async">core.async</a> channels that
won&rsquo;t melt in your hands.</em></p>

<p><em>To construct a channel simply use <em>chan</em></em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">talk-to-otters-chan</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">chan</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Channels by default are unbuffered, which keeps them at the
mini-marshmallow size.  It requires a rendezvous of a channel producer
and consumer to communicate.  In the case of otters, someone to talk to
the otters and the otters, themselves, to listen. Be advised that with
a regular blocking put <strong>>!!</strong>, the main thread will be blocked.
That is, if you try to speak to the otter, you will be stuck there
until it gets around to listening. This isn&rsquo;t the best case for the talker if the
otter was busy, so one approach would be to use a
<a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/future">future</a> to
talk to the otter with a blocking put <em>>!!</em>.</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">future</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">&gt;!!</span> <span class="nv">talk-to-otters-chan</span> <span class="s">&quot;Hello otters.&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="c1">;=&gt;#&lt;Future@3c371c41: :pending&gt;</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>One could also use a buffered channel, but that increases the size of
the marshmallow.</p>

<p>Amy put one of the mini-marshmallows in her ear.  She immediately
began to hear the conversation that Frank was having with the otters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who would want to destroy the entire world?  That is really kinda
over-board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know, but there was someone on Galactic Hacker News
the other day that was quite tiffed over the idea that Clojure was considered
a Lisp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amy reached to put the other marshmallow in her mouth to ask a very
important question.  But unfortunately, as she moved her hand, she
accidentally pushed the big red <em>Source</em> button on the evaluator.
Suddenly, she and Frank were swept up in a vortex that spun them
around and sucked them down into the ground.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amy and Frank were hurtled quite rapidly through time and space after
attaching themselves to a transaction headed through the
<a href="http://docs.datomic.com/transactions.html">Datomic Transactor</a>. From
there things slowed down a bit, then took a sharp left and
ricocheted off again with incredible speed until they landed in another
<a href="http://docs.datomic.com/architecture.html">Datomic Peer</a>, and finally
appeared in the same room.  Amy was quite startled by the
anti-climatic nature of the whole dematerializing and rematerializing
in the same exact spot, and didn&rsquo;t really know what to do next.  She
surveyed her office and found it exactly the same,
except for two distinct details.  For one, the pistachio shells had
disappeared, and for another, the date on the computer showed
yesterday at 8:00 am.  She tried to connect these facts rationally
with the pistachios in her pocket and finally said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am about to come into work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank, who was busily hunting through his blue zippered pack around
his waist, looked up briefly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we better get out of here then, I only have a blue fanny pack.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to Clojure explains that the &ldquo;fanny pack&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;bum bag&rdquo;, is the symbol of a licensed Chrono-agent.  The rank of the
Chrono-agent can be clearly determined by its color on the ROYGBIV
scale.</em></p>

<p><em>The origins of this licensing method can be traced to an embarrassing
incident in human history known as &ldquo;The Great Flood&rdquo;. A junior
Chrono-agent was trying to increase the yield of a tomato crop during
a dry spell and was trying to do the following recursive function in his evaluator:</em></p>

<p><em>The following is a cautionary example of the unpredictable
combination of Clojure, a marathon viewing of the BBC&rsquo;s series &ldquo;The
Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy&rdquo;, and a questionable amount of
cheese.</em></p>

<p>There have been many tourism guides to the
<a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> programming language.  Some that easily
come to mind for their intellectual erudition and prose are &ldquo;The Joy
of Touring Clojure&rdquo;, &ldquo;Touring Clojure&rdquo;, &ldquo;Clojure Touring&rdquo;, and the
newest edition of &ldquo;Touring Clojure Touring&rdquo;.  However, none has
surpassed the wild popularity of &ldquo;The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to Clojure&rdquo;.
It has sold over 500 million copies and has been on the &ldquo;BigInt&rsquo;s
Board of Programming Language Tourism&rdquo; for the past 15 years. While,
arguably, it
lacked the in-depth coverage of the other guides, it made up for it in
useful practical tips, such as what to do if you find a nil in your
pistachio.  Most of all, the cover had the following words printed in
very large letters: <strong>Don&rsquo;t Worry About the Parens</strong>.</p>

<p>To tell the story of the book, it is best to tell the story of two
people whose lives were affected by it: Amy Denn, one of the last
remaining <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language">Pascal</a> developers in Cincinnati, and Frank Pecan, a time
traveler, guidebook reseacher, and friend of Amy.</p>

<p>Amy, at this moment, was completely unaware of the chronological
advantages of her friend, being preoccupied with the stark fact that
she was about to be fired.  She had been given a direct order from her
CEO to deploy the code at 3:05pm.  It was now 3:00pm and she had
realized that if she did so, all the data painstaking collected about
the effects of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuvan_throat_singing">Throat Singing</a> on
the growth rate of tomatoes would be erased. Unfortunately, the CEO
did not really understand or trust anything having to do with
technology or programming.  In truth, the only two things that he
seemed to care about were tomatoes and checklists of unreasonable
things. The fact that no course of action available to her in the next
5 minutes would help her employment situation, agitated Amy so much
that she was violently shelling and eating pistachio nuts.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to Clojure&rdquo; says that
<em>pistachios are Nature&rsquo;s
most perfect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">s-expression</a>. An
s-expression is recursively composed of s-expressions or an atom.
In the case of the humble pistachio, the atom is the nut inside. The
atom simply evaluates to itself.  This is best seen is an example
where the following expressions are evaluated in the Clojure
<a href="http://tryclj.com/">REPL</a></em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="s">&quot;hi&quot;</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; &quot;hi&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; 1</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">true</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; true</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">nil</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; nil</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>`</p>

<p><em>Which leads to the very practical tip of what to do if you find a nil
in your pistachio.  The answer, of course, is to be thankful that you
have a value that represents the absence of a value &ndash; and to get
another pistachio.</em></p>

<p><em>In Clojure, a s-expression is written with parens.  The first element
within the parens is an operator or function and the rest of the
elements are treated as data, some of which can be s-expression
themselves.</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; 3</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; 5</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Considering the pistachio again, we can think of the nut in the shell
as an s-expression, (providing we also imagine an operator or function
right in front of the nut).</em></p>

<p><em>Here we define a function that will turn the nut red, by appending the
string &ldquo;red&rdquo; to the nut-name.</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">red</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">nut</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">str </span><span class="s">&quot;red &quot;</span> <span class="nv">nut</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">red</span> <span class="s">&quot;nut1&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; &quot;red nut1&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Notice that if we put a quote in front of the expression, it will no
longer be evaluated.</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">red</span> <span class="s">&quot;nut1&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; (red &quot;nut1&quot;)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>quoting the expression turns it into a list, which we can then
manipulate with other s-expressions (code as data).</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">last </span><span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">red</span> <span class="s">&quot;nut1&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; &quot;nut1&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>If we try to evaluate the s-expression with just the nut name in the
parens, we get an error because there is no function in
the first slot.</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;nut1&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;=&gt; ClassCastException java.lang.String cannot be cast to clojure.lang.IFn</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>The whole thing of having to have a function in front of the nut in
the pistachio has invited much heated debate on the suitability of
pistachios being held up as the paragon of an s-expression.  But
critics have failed to explain the corroborating evidence of red
pistachio nuts, or find a more suitable nut.</em></p>

<p>Amy&rsquo;s time traveling friend, Frank, is due to appear on the scene
momentarily to reveal that the whole world is really made of Clojure
<a href="http://www.datomic.com/">Datomic</a> datoms.  Furthermore, a transaction
is going to be evaluated soon, which will retract all the facts on
EVERYTHING. The practical effect of this will be that nothing will
have an attributes. A world without any attributes at all would be
quite boring and, for all purposes, be non-existent. Luckily for Amy, Frank is a Datomic Time
Traveller and has a hand-held &ldquo;evaluator&rdquo; which will save them. Also
luckily, the readers will be spared dialog, since the author
can never figure out where to put the punctuation and is really
rubbish at it.  Only one phrase will be illustrated.  This is the
rather important one, having been uttered by Amy after it was explained to her
that she, and the entire world around her, was entirely composed of
Clojure:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the language with a lot of parens?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To which, Frank handed her the &ldquo;Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to Clojure&rdquo; and
pointed to the words on the front cover,  <strong>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Worry About the
Parens.&rdquo;</strong>, and turned to the first page.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;There is absolutely no need to worry about the parens. It is known
 today that the first really important discovery of humankind was not
 fire, but <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit">Paredit</a>.  Paredit
 mode magically acts to insert and balance the right parens to the
 point where they actually can no longer be seen.  This is evident by
 just looking around you. The world is made of Clojure and there are
 millions, billions, and trillions of parens all around you and your
 tea cup right now.  Yet, you don&rsquo;t see them.  Paredit mode.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>At the urging of Frank, Amy quickly stuffed the remaining pistachios
in her pockets while he readied his evaluator. The display showed
some large integer value, that decreased as he pushed the buttons on
the console.  Finally, he pushed the large red button and two parens
started glowing on either side of them &hellip; and they disappeared.</p>

    <link href="http://gigasquid.github.io/blog/2014/01/09/lean-customer-interview-tips-for-the-introverted-developer/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-09T21:23:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://gigasquid.github.io/blog/2014/01/09/lean-customer-interview-tips-for-the-introverted-developer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4029/4356643150_9b26a637e9.jpg"></p>

<p>After attending a local Lean Startup Circle meetup, I decided to write
about some of my experiences with the
<a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup Methodology</a> from a software
developer&rsquo;s point of view.</p>

<h2>Why should you care about the Lean Startup Methodology?</h2>

<p>As software developer, I put my passion, honed expertise, and time
into crafting a digital product or service. One of the worst things
that can happen is that when it is released, no one uses it or wants
it. You can build a absolutely beautiful software product that scales
to the nines. But if you build the wrong thing, it is a failure.</p>

<p>The Lean Startup Methodology is basically a scientific approach to
developing business and products. You analyze your assumptions and
then devise experiments to test your hypotheses. One of the ways that
you can test them, is by talking to people and doing customer
interviews.</p>

<h2>Talking to Random People is Terrifying</h2>

<p>The prospect of talking to random people on the street is a terrifying
prospect for me as a semi-introverted software developer. It is also
incredibly useful to get out of the office and actually get feedback.
These tips come from a Lean Startup Weekend in Columbus at the Neo
office, where I successfully got
out of my comfort zone and engaged in customer interviews.</p>

<p>Background:  Our team was designing experiments around creating an app
for Food Trucks.  The fundamental assumption that we wanted to
validate was &ndash; &ldquo;People will pay money for a phone app that will tell
them where all the Food Trucks are.&rdquo;  So we headed downtown to the
local food market. This was a place where there were local artisan
food vendors in a food hall.  It seemed like an ideal place to find
people interested in good food and Food Trucks.</p>

<h3>Tip #1 &ndash; You will suck at first, but it gets better</h3>

<p>The first few people I tried to talk were complete failures. I felt
like a complete idiot. Do not get discouraged.  It helps if you go
with someone else for moral support, although you should interview
people by yourself, so they don&rsquo;t feel intimidated.</p>

<h3>Tip #2 &ndash; Have your questions written down</h3>

<p>Come prepared with the questions that you want to ask people, so you
don&rsquo;t have a brain freeze with nervousness.  However, I found I got
people to talk to me more if I didn&rsquo;t carry the pad of paper with me.
Basically anything you can do to look less like a marketer helps.</p>

<h3>Tip #3 &ndash; Tell them what you are trying to build first</h3>

<p>DO NOT START OUT LIKE THIS:  &ldquo;Can I ask you a few questions?&rdquo;
This never worked. Again, this is what a marketer would say.
I got my best responses by telling people that I was a software
developer looking to build a app for Food Trucks. In most cases, they
were happy to give advice on whether they would use the app and how
much they would pay for it.</p>

<h3>Tip #4 &ndash; Write down your results right away</h3>

<p>Memory is a fleeting thing.  Try to record the results of your
conversation right away.  Take the notepad from your pocket and go to
a corner or table and note everything down, before you forgot it all.
Also try to write down what the person said, not just your
interpretation. If someone is helping you interview, you can have one
person be a scribe, while one person talks.</p>

<h3>Tip #5 &ndash; Give Gifts</h3>

<p>If you have any funding available for this endeavor, you can get a
stack of Amazon $10 gift cards for people&rsquo;s time. This was some advice
given to us. I didn&rsquo;t actually try it for this particular outing, but
I have heard that others have used it very successfully.</p>

<h2>Getting out of your Comfort Zone is Scary but Rewarding</h2>

<p>I certainly got out of my comfort zone as a developer that weekend.
But the end result was worth it.  We ended up disproving our
hypothesis the people would pay for our app.  Almost all the people we
interviewed said that they would download the app, but no one was
willing to pay for it.  We invalidated a core assumption, it was a
success.</p>

<p>We could move on to testing and validating another idea that could be a viable business product.</p>

<p>Build things that matter.  Build well. Build the right things.</p>

    <link href="http://gigasquid.github.io/blog/2013/12/26/guide-to-leaving-your-mac-laptop/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://gigasquid.github.io/blog/2013/12/26/guide-to-leaving-your-mac-laptop</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3795/11572063123_6baf3b35c2.jpg"></p>

<p>I felt like I was in a controlling relationship headed downhill.
After two custom laptops returned for defective hardware, I wanted to
leave.  But leaving didn&rsquo;t seem so easy after living in the walled
garden of Apple all those years.</p>

<p>This blog post is about how to leave your Mac and return to OSS.</p>

<h2>Make a New Plan, Stan</h2>

<p>There are quite a few nice alternatives to the Mac Air out there.
I decided to go with the new
<a href="http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/xps-13-linux/pd">Sputnik 3</a>.
Some of my reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Powerful &ndash; New Haswell processor</li>
<li>13.3 inch touch display with 1920 x 1080 resolution</li>
<li>Ships with Ubuntu 12.04 (64 bit)</li>
<li>Nice design (yes looks are important)</li>
</ul>


<p>It arrived a couple of days before Christmas. The packaging itself
was quite nice.  Here is a picture next
to my 13 inch Mac Air.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7334/11572078553_7efe0e609e.jpg"></p>

<p>The best was that everything just &ldquo;worked&rdquo; out of the box.
I had no problems configuring Ubuntu and getting the wireless network
hooked up.  I could close the lid and reopen it and have &ldquo;instant on&rdquo;
just like the Mac Air.  The keyboard is enjoyable to use and nicely
backlit.  The sleek design and light weight of the laptop is very
comparable to the Mac Air.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3753/11571869965_06975d698c.jpg"></p>

<h2>Hop on the Bus, Gus</h2>

<p>It took my about a day to set up all my programs that I use on a daily
basis.
Here is a overview:</p>

<h4>Application Dock/ Organization &ndash; Dash</h4>

<p>Ubuntu has a dock on the left hand side of the screen, that is very
similar to the mac one.  You can right click and pin applications to
the dock to keep them in there. Clicking into the dash option, you can
browse your applications that are installed.</p>

<h4>Getting New Apps &ndash; Ubuntu Software Center or apt-get</h4>

<p>You can install new applications easily by using the Ubuntu Software
Center.  Browsing the applications and installing them is point and
click easy. If you don&rsquo;t see the one you need or need a more recent
version, you can always install via the command line with</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install package-name
</code></pre>

<h4>Browser &ndash; Firefox or Chromium</h4>

<p>Ubuntu comes with Firefox and Chromium installed.
You can also go with Chrome of course.</p>

<h4>Mail &ndash; Thunderbird</h4>

<p>Ubuntu comes with Thunderbird mail ready to go.
I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to setup Thunderbird
Mail.  You simply put in your email and password.  Ubuntu keeps a
configuration list of commonly used email providers.  It automagically
figured out the correct domains and ports to use. On the downside, it
doesn&rsquo;t do anything magic with your contacts. So you are on your own
there.  I also just found out about
<a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/10/geary-0-4-released-with-new-look-new-features">Geary</a>,
which looks pretty sweet.</p>

<h4>Password Management &ndash; 1 Password Anywhere + Dropbox / LastPass</h4>

<p>There is not a linux client for 1Password. I can still use it by using
<a href="http://help.agilebits.com/1Password3/1passwordanywhere.html">1PasswordAnywhere</a>.
I just have a bookmark to the 1PasswordAnyway link and I haz my
logins. I am switching over to LastPass though, so you can edit / add
new passwords. There is also an import utility to move stuff over from 1Password.</p>

<h4>Emacs</h4>

<p>Emacs just works :)
It might be just me, but I think it is happier back on Ubuntu.
I did an apt-get to get the 24 version.</p>

<h4>Git Client</h4>

<p>I went with gitg for a graphical Git client. It seems to have all the
things you need.</p>

<h4>Terminal &ndash; Byobu</h4>

<p><a href="http://byobu.co/">Byobu Terminal</a> comes already installed in Ubuntu. I have been taking
it for a test drive and really like some of the features of easily
adding new tabs, splitting screens and re-attaching to sessions.</p>

<h4>Evernote/ Everpad</h4>

<p>With
<a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/09/use-evernote-in-ubuntu-with-everpad">Everpad</a>,
I can still use all my evernote stuff too.</p>

<h4>Presentations &ndash; LibreOffice / Reveal.js</h4>

<p>I have used Keynote heavily on the Mac.  For existing presentations, I
can convert them to ppt format and then modify or run in LibreOffice
Impress. Most likely with all my new presentations, I will just use a
JavaScript framework like <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">reveal.js</a></p>

<h4>Communication &ndash; Hipchat / Skype/ Google Hangouts / Campfire</h4>

<p>We use Hipchat for messaging at work.  Hipchat has a linux client
that works just the same.  Skype also has a linux client.  Of course,
Google Hangouts is just fine on the web.  I also use Campfire
sometimes. There are a couple of linux clients out there, but I
haven&rsquo;t tried them yet.  The web version works fine for me right now.</p>

<h4>iPhone</h4>

<p>On my mac, I used to plug in my phone and sync to my dropbox.  I tried
plugging in my phone, but unfortunately, iOS7 put in a security
feature to that prevents having the phone connect properly.  The
solution for me is to just use the phone dropbox app to sync the
pictures automatically to my Dropbox.</p>

<h2>Get Yourself Free</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t expect the road to free of bumps.  I have only been using my
new laptop for a week.  But so far, it has been an enjoyable switch.
The hardware is really impressive, and it feels good getting back to
OSS.</p>

<p>Best of all, I set myself free.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After having spent some time recently looking at top-down AI, I
thought I would spend some time looking at bottom&rsquo;s up AI, machine
learning and neural networks.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly introduced to <a href="https://twitter.com/mikera">@mikea&rsquo;s</a> <a href="https://github.com/mikera/core.matrix">core.matrix</a> at Clojure Conj
this year and wanted to try making my own neural network using the
library. The purpose of this blog is to share my learnings along the
way.</p>

<h2>What is a neural network?</h2>

<p>A neural network is an approach to machine learning that involves
simulating, (in an idealized way), the way our brains work on a
biological level.  There are three layers to neural network: the input
layer, the hidden layers, and the output layer.  Each layer consists
of neurons that have a value.  In each layer, each neuron is connected to
the neuron in the next layer by a connection strength. To get data
into the neural network, you assign values to the input layer, (values
between 0 and 1). These values are then &ldquo;fed forward&rdquo; to the hidden layer neurons though an algorithm that
relies on the input values and the connection strengths. The values
are finally &ldquo;fed forward&rdquo; in a similar fashion to the output layer.
The &ldquo;learning&rdquo; portion of the neural network comes from &ldquo;training&rdquo; the
network data.  The training data consists of a collection of
associated input values and target values. The training process at a
high level looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Feed forward input values to get the output values</li>
<li>How far off are the output values from the target values?</li>
<li>Calculate the error values and adjust the strengths of the network</li>
<li>Repeat until you think it has &ldquo;learned&rdquo; enough, that is when you
feed the input values in the result of the output values are close
enough to the target you are looking for</li>
</ul>


<p>The beauty of this system is that the neural network, (given the right
configuration and the right training), can approximate any function &ndash;
just by exposing it to data.</p>

<h2>Start Small</h2>

<p>I wanted to start with a very small network so that I could understand
the algorithms and actually do the maths for the tests along the way.
The network configuration I chose is one with 1 hidden layer.  The
input layer has 2 neurons, the hidden layer has 3 neurons and the
output layer has 2 neurons.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In this example we have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Input Neurons: neuronA neuronB</li>
<li>Hidden Neurons: neuron1 neuron2 neuron3</li>
<li>Output Neurons: neuronC neuronD</li>
<li>Connections between the Input and Hidden Layers

<ul>
<li>neuronA-neuron1</li>
<li>neuronA-neuron2</li>
<li>neuronA-neuron3</li>
<li>neuronB-neuron1</li>
<li>neuronB-neuron2</li>
<li>neuronB-neuron3</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Connections betwen the Hidden and Output Layers

<ul>
<li>neuron1-nerounC</li>
<li>neuron1-nerounD</li>
<li>neuron2-nerounC</li>
<li>neuron2-nerounD</li>
<li>neuron3-nerounC</li>
<li>neuron3-nerounD</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>To give us a concrete example to work with, let&rsquo;s actually assign all
our neurons and connection strengths to some real values.</p>

<h2>Feed Forward</h2>

<p>Alright, we have values in the input neuron layer, let&rsquo;s feed them
forward through the network. The new value of neuron in the hidden
layer is the sum of all the inputs of its connections multiplied by
the connection strength.  The neuron can also have its own threshold,
(meaning you would subtract the threshold from the sum of inputs), but
to keep things a simple as possible in this example, the threshold is
0 &ndash; so we will ignore it.  The sum is then feed into an activation
function, that has an output in the range of -1 to 1.  The activation
function is the tanh function.  We will also need the derivative of
the tanh function a little later when we are calculating errors, so we
will define both here.</p>

<p>Alright!  We have our answer
[0.02315019005321053 0.027608061500083565].
Notice that the values are pretty much the same.  This is because we
haven&rsquo;t trained our network to do anything yet.</p>

<h2>Backwards Propagation</h2>

<p>To train our network, we have to let it know what the answer,(or
target), should be, so we can calculate the errors and finally update
our connection strengths. For this simple example, let&rsquo;s just inverse
the data &ndash; so given an input of [1 0] should give us an output of
[0 1].</p>

<h3>Calculate the errors of the hidden layer</h3>

<p>The errors of the hidden layer are based off the deltas that we just
found from the output layer.  In fact, for each hidden neuron, the
error delta is the gradient of the activation function multiplied by
the weighted sum of the ouput deltas of connected ouput neurons and
it&rsquo;s connection strength.  This should remind you of the forward
propagation of the inputs &ndash; but this time we are doing it backwards
with the error deltas.</p>

<h3>Updating the connection strengths</h3>

<p>Great!  We have all the error deltas, now we are ready to go ahead and
update the connection strengths.  In general this is the same process
for both the hidden-output connections and the input-hidden
connections.</p>

<ul>
<li>weight-change = error-delta * neuron-value</li>
<li>new-weight = weight + learning rate * weight-change</li>
</ul>


<p>The learning rate controls how fast the weigths and errors should be
adjusted.  It the learning rate is too high, then there is the danger
that it will converge to fit the solution too fast and not find the
best solution.  If the learning rate is too low, it may never actually
converge to the right solution given the training data that it is
using. For this example, let&rsquo;s use a training rate of 0.2</p>

<h2>Putting the pieces together</h2>

<p>We have done it!  In our simple example we have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Forward propagated the input to get the output</li>
<li>Calculated the errors from the target through backpropogation</li>
<li>Updated the connection strengths/ weights</li>
</ul>


<p>We just need to put all the pieces together. We&rsquo;ll do this with the
values that we got earlier to make sure it is all working.</p>

<h3>Construct a network representation</h3>

<p>It would be nice if we could represent an entire neural network in a
data structure.  That way the whole transformation of feeding forward
and training the network could give us a new network back.
So lets define the data structure as
[input-neurons input-hidden-strengths hidden-neurons hidden-output-strengths output-neurons].</p>

<p>We will start off with all the values of the neurons being zero.</p>

<h3>Generalized feed forward</h3>

constructs a new network based on input values and the

<p>Whoa!  The trained example isn&rsquo;t perfect, but we can see that it is
getting closer to the right answer.  It is learning!</p>

<h2>MOR Training Data</h2>

<p>Well this is really cool and it is working.  But it would be nicer to
be able to present a set of training data for it to learn on.  For
example, it would be nice to have a training data structure look like:</p>

<p>Now we can construct our network from scratch and train it.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it.  We have constucted a neural network with core.matrix</p>

<h2>Want more?</h2>

<p>I put together a github library based on the neural network code in
the posts.  It is called <a href="https://github.com/gigasquid/k9">K9</a>, named
after Dr. Who&rsquo;s best dog friend.  You can find the examples we have
gone through in the tests.  There is also an example program using it
in the examples directory.  It learns what colors are based on thier
RGB value.</p>

<p>There are a couple web resources I would recommend if you want to look
farther as well.</p>

</ul>


<p>Go forth and create Neural Networks!</p>
