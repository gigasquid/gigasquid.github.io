  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Long ago,  I worked for a couple years as a professional ballet dancer with a small company. Reflecting on this, I have an interesting perspective of working in field were woman are the majority and also one where women are in the minority. I thought I would dedicate this post a few observations of similarities between men in ballet and women in software development.</p>

<p><strong>Men in Ballet</strong>
<img class="left" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3786/9925846994_2673f8183c_o.jpg"></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Have some lame people think ballet is just for girls and make assumptions about them based on cultural stereotypes</p></li>
<li><p>Have to have a sense of humor to handle accidentally injuries due to kicks or slips while rehearsing choreography with women.</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly love what they do. Otherwise, they most likely would have never overcome the social pressure to pursue their craft.</p></li>
<li><p>Partner when ballerinas to create great performances. The diversity of having men and women dance together allows more freedom of expression in the choreography. Ultimately, that produces a show that is more valuable and pleasing to the audience.</p></li>
<li><p>Usually have no wait in line for the men&rsquo;s restroom during ballet performance intermissions.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Women in Software Development</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Have some lame people think software development is just for boys and make assumptions about them based on cultural stereotypes.</p></li>
<li><p>Have to have a sense of humor to handle accidental insensitive remarks due to slips in conversation when working with men. (Ex: hot chicks, rude jokes, etc&hellip;.)</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly love what they do. Otherwise, they most likely would have never overcome the social pressure to pursue their craft.</p></li>
<li><p>Partner with other software developers to create great software. More diversity*, allows more freedom of expression in understanding and applying technology to solve business needs. Ultimately, that produces software that is more valuable and pleasing to the business and user.</p></li>
<li><p>Usually have no wait in line for the women&rsquo;s restroom during technical conference breaks.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>*And yes, the diversity I am talking about is not limited to just men and women.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Since joining EdgeCase, I have shelved my heavy Intellij and Eclipse IDEs in favor of Emacs. Overall, I have enjoyed moving to the light-weight but powerful editor. There is one thing that I did miss from my IDEs – that was the ability to search projects for string occurrences and being able to click navigate to them through the editor. Fortunately, one of the strengths of Emacs is it&rsquo;s infinite configurability and extensibility. Even more fortunate, one of the guys in our shared office, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dougalcorn">Doug Alcorn</a> of Gaslight Software, had already written just this feature for his Emacs. I installed it and was so pleased with it, that I thought I would share …</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I got the chance to share my enthusiasm for two of my favorite technologies at JRubyConf by giving a presentation on Semantic Web and JRuby. It was an excellent experience. I was able to connect with other people that shared my interest in the Semantic Web and some that have even worked with the technologies professionally. Most exciting, I had the opportunity to share my knowledge and hopefully inspire others to look farther into using JRuby with the Jena Semantic Web Framework.</p>

<p>Here are some resources from the presentation that I wanted to share with everyone:</p>

<p>On github, <a href="https://github.com/gigasquid/jruby_semantic_web_examples">https://github.com/gigasquid/jruby_semantic_web_examples</a>, I put together some examples of SPARQL queries against dbpedia as well as translating the examples that they have on the <a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/tutorial/RDF_API/index.html">Jena RDF API</a> to use JRuby</p>

<p>Here is the presentation itself:

<p>A special note of thanks to <a href="http://foaf-visualizer.org/?uri=http://purl.org/net/bsletten">Brian Sletten</a>, the Semantic Web guru, who inspired and exposed me to the Semantic Web, helped me out by answering my questions and pointing me in the right direction and for just being a swell guy.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Deploying Clojure apps with a single command to the cloud is now possible with Heroku Cedar and let me tell you, it is pure joy.</p>

<p>I experimented with this the other day by creating a Compojure web application that compares the followers that two twitter users have in common.</p>

<p>Here is the secret sauce you need to push your apps to Heroku:</p>

<p>1) <strong>Procfile: </strong>
You need to create a file in the root of your directory that contains the way to start up your application:</p>

<pre><code> web: lein run -m ring-twitter-common.core
</code></pre>

<p>2) The application must have the project.clj setup correctly so that you can just run:</p>

<pre><code>lein deps
</code></pre>

<p>3) You need to install the <a href="https://github.com/heroku/heroku">Heroku gem</a></p>

<p>Once you have this setup you simply do:</p>

<pre><code>heroku create --stack cedar




git push heroku master
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. Your webapp will auto-magically be created, and deployed and be available for your viewing pleasure.</p>

<p>You can check out  my sample Twitter Heroku app here:
<a href="http://ring-twitter-common.herokuapp.com/">http://ring-twitter-common.herokuapp.com/</a></p>

<p>But wait, you say&hellip; wouldn&rsquo;t it be awesome if you could just write your Clojure app and say lein deploy and have it all work? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be super awesome if there was some command to generate a skeleton for your Compojure app? The solution is actually in the planning stages by James Reeves (weavejester)!  Hooray!</p>

<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/leiningen/browse_thread/thread/1f3fbb808542adc6">Leiningen Google Group Text</a></p>

<p>In summary:  Developing Clojure Web Apps just got easier and the future is only looking up :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I have been happily using <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> and <a href="https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery">Jasmine-JQuery</a> on a project with great success. However, I was still unsure about how to handle mocking the ajax calls back to the server. It turns out the answer is already in Jasmine. Time to call out the spies!</p>

<p>There is a wiki page on spies <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/wiki/Spies">https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/wiki/Spies</a>, but I always enjoy a nice code sample.</p>

<p>In my source file I have an ajax call that I would like to mock that looks like this:
[gist id=957387]</p>

<p>Now in my spec file &ndash; I setup a spy on the ajax call and use andCallFake to mock the call. When the method is tested, the ajax call will be mocked and return through the success handler. You can pass data back through the fakeData var.

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Lately, I have been working on the awesome open source project <a href="http://www.4clojure.com/">4Clojure.com</a>. The site helps you to learn Clojure by solving “koan” type problems in an interactive format. One of the enhancements that I was looking at putting in was a way to enter code in a text box and have it color highlight as type. I found the <a href="http://ace.ajax.org/">ACE project</a>, which looked like exactly what I wanted. However, sad panda, they didn&rsquo;t have a Clojure mode. Not deterred, I decided that I would try to take a crack at it. I ported most of the rules from the Clojure brush in Syntax Highlighter over and implemented some basic auto-indent.</p>

<p>The Github source has been added to the main project at Ace <a href="https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace">https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace</a>
You can see it in action on the 4Clojure.com site here: <a href="http://www.4clojure.com/problem/14">http://www.4clojure.com/problem/14</a></p>

The Katas are taken more or less from the Coding Kata site <a href="http://codingkata.org/katas/">http://codingkata.org/katas/</a>. The projects both include the basic project setup for you to get started with TDD beginner katas.</p>

<p>The Ruby project has tests in the form of rspec-given, which is quite fun. The Clojure project has tests in the form of Midje, which has a lovely syntax.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Recently, I decided to work on a set of code Katas.  I couldn&rsquo;t decide whether to do them in Ruby or Clojure, so I decided to do them in both.  I did the Kata in Ruby first and then immediately followed up with the same one in Clojure.  It was an interesting exercise, not only for the learning of the languages, but to highlight how I thought about the problems differently depending on the language.</p>

<p>Ruby is a fantastic language.  It would delight and sometimes surprise me with how elegant and natural it was to solve problems.  When I approached the Kata, I found myself thinking, “How can I make this more readable?”.   Ruby never failed to please.</p>

<p>Clojure is also a wonderful language.  One of the things that I really enjoy about it is that it changed that way that I approach problems.  This was particularly evident when I turned to solve the same problem in Ruby that I just had in Clojure.  First and foremost, I thought about the data.  Then about how the data could be transformed.  The transformation isn&rsquo;t like the serial steps that you normally take to hold the data in your hand and bit by bit mold it into the result – like a sculptor with clay.  It is the kind of transformation that takes a rolled ball of yarn and transforms into a beautiful lace pattern.</p>

<p>The closest that I had come to this functional way of thinking was when I was doing some heavy SQL and database work.  I went to a talk by Jay Pipes on MySQL.  I remember him saying that to be really good at SQL, you needed to think in sets.  You couldn&rsquo;t effectively solve the queries with the regular programming for-loop construct.  You needed to think of the sets of data joining and intersecting and the transformations needed to be applied to the data elements.  The same focus on the data seemed to hold true for Clojure too.</p>

<p>I highly recommend both Ruby and Clojure as programming languages.  Each are dynamic, elegant and powerful and a lot of fun.  Next time you sit down to do a Kata, and can&rsquo;t decide what language to use, try them both – and let me know how you think&hellip;</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>We took our kids bowling for the first time the other day. I have to admit, that I am not a great bowler. I had only been bowling two or three times in my life previous to that event and I was very thankful that those bumpers were up. The computer program malfunctioned in the final frames of our last game. I realized then, that I really had no idea how to score bowling. Later that night, in my surfing, I came across a reference to the <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata">Bowling Game Kata</a>.</p>

<p>Such Kata serendipity could not be ignored. I decided to implement it in Clojure using defrecords to mimic the object model with Frames and the Game and use STM to keep the state of the Game in an atom. Finally, the unit tests are using <a href="https://github.com/marick/Midje">Midje</a> facts – which has a syntax that I enjoy.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a great learning exercise and as a bonus&hellip; I know how to score a bowling game now!</p>
