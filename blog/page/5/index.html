		<p>Since joining EdgeCase, I have shelved my heavy Intellij and Eclipse IDEs in favor of Emacs. Overall, I have enjoyed moving to the light-weight but powerful editor. There is one thing that I did miss from my IDEs – that was the ability to search projects for string occurrences and being able to click navigate to them through the editor. Fortunately, one of the strengths of Emacs is it&rsquo;s infinite configurability and extensibility. Even more fortunate, one of the guys in our shared office, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dougalcorn">Doug Alcorn</a> of Gaslight Software, had already written just this feature for his Emacs. I installed it and was so pleased with it, that I thought I would share …</p>

		<p>I got the chance to share my enthusiasm for two of my favorite technologies at JRubyConf by giving a presentation on Semantic Web and JRuby. It was an excellent experience. I was able to connect with other people that shared my interest in the Semantic Web and some that have even worked with the technologies professionally. Most exciting, I had the opportunity to share my knowledge and hopefully inspire others to look farther into using JRuby with the Jena Semantic Web Framework.</p>

<p>Here are some resources from the presentation that I wanted to share with everyone:</p>

<p>On github, <a href="https://github.com/gigasquid/jruby_semantic_web_examples">https://github.com/gigasquid/jruby_semantic_web_examples</a>, I put together some examples of SPARQL queries against dbpedia as well as translating the examples that they have on the <a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/tutorial/RDF_API/index.html">Jena RDF API</a> to use JRuby</p>

<p>Here is the presentation itself:
<a href="https://github.com/gigasquid/Presentations/blob/master/SemanticWebJRuby.pdf">https://github.com/gigasquid/Presentations/blob/master/SemanticWebJRuby.pdf</a></p>

<p>A special note of thanks to <a href="http://foaf-visualizer.org/?uri=http://purl.org/net/bsletten">Brian Sletten</a>, the Semantic Web guru, who inspired and exposed me to the Semantic Web, helped me out by answering my questions and pointing me in the right direction and for just being a swell guy.</p>

		<p>Deploying Clojure apps with a single command to the cloud is now possible with Heroku Cedar and let me tell you, it is pure joy.</p>

<p>I experimented with this the other day by creating a Compojure web application that compares the followers that two twitter users have in common.</p>

<p>Here is the secret sauce you need to push your apps to Heroku:</p>

<p>1) <strong>Procfile: </strong>
You need to create a file in the root of your directory that contains the way to start up your application:</p>

<pre><code> web: lein run -m ring-twitter-common.core
</code></pre>

<p>2) The application must have the project.clj setup correctly so that you can just run:</p>

<pre><code>lein deps
</code></pre>

<p>3) You need to install the <a href="https://github.com/heroku/heroku">Heroku gem</a></p>

<p>Once you have this setup you simply do:</p>

<pre><code>heroku create --stack cedar




git push heroku master
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. Your webapp will auto-magically be created, and deployed and be available for your viewing pleasure.</p>

<p>You can check out  my sample Twitter Heroku app here:
<a href="http://ring-twitter-common.herokuapp.com/">http://ring-twitter-common.herokuapp.com/</a></p>

<p>But wait, you say&hellip; wouldn&rsquo;t it be awesome if you could just write your Clojure app and say lein deploy and have it all work? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be super awesome if there was some command to generate a skeleton for your Compojure app? The solution is actually in the planning stages by James Reeves (weavejester)!  Hooray!</p>

<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/leiningen/browse_thread/thread/1f3fbb808542adc6">Leiningen Google Group Text</a></p>

<p>In summary:  Developing Clojure Web Apps just got easier and the future is only looking up :)</p>

		<p>I have been happily using <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> and <a href="https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery">Jasmine-JQuery</a> on a project with great success. However, I was still unsure about how to handle mocking the ajax calls back to the server. It turns out the answer is already in Jasmine. Time to call out the spies!</p>

<p>There is a wiki page on spies <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/wiki/Spies">https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/wiki/Spies</a>, but I always enjoy a nice code sample.</p>

<p>In my source file I have an ajax call that I would like to mock that looks like this:
[gist id=957387]</p>

<p>Now in my spec file &ndash; I setup a spy on the ajax call and use andCallFake to mock the call. When the method is tested, the ajax call will be mocked and return through the success handler. You can pass data back through the fakeData var.

		<p>Lately, I have been working on the awesome open source project <a href="http://www.4clojure.com/">4Clojure.com</a>. The site helps you to learn Clojure by solving “koan” type problems in an interactive format. One of the enhancements that I was looking at putting in was a way to enter code in a text box and have it color highlight as type. I found the <a href="http://ace.ajax.org/">ACE project</a>, which looked like exactly what I wanted. However, sad panda, they didn&rsquo;t have a Clojure mode. Not deterred, I decided that I would try to take a crack at it. I ported most of the rules from the Clojure brush in Syntax Highlighter over and implemented some basic auto-indent.</p>

<p>The Github source has been added to the main project at Ace <a href="https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace">https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace</a>
You can see it in action on the 4Clojure.com site here: <a href="http://www.4clojure.com/problem/14">http://www.4clojure.com/problem/14</a></p>

		<p>I have put a couple projects out on GitHub to help people get started with Clojure and Ruby.
The Katas are taken more or less from the Coding Kata site <a href="http://codingkata.org/katas/">http://codingkata.org/katas/</a>. The projects both include the basic project setup for you to get started with TDD beginner katas.</p>

<p>The Ruby project has tests in the form of rspec-given, which is quite fun. The Clojure project has tests in the form of Midje, which has a lovely syntax.</p>

<p>Please give them a try :)</p>

		<p>Recently, I decided to work on a set of code Katas.  I couldn&rsquo;t decide whether to do them in Ruby or Clojure, so I decided to do them in both.  I did the Kata in Ruby first and then immediately followed up with the same one in Clojure.  It was an interesting exercise, not only for the learning of the languages, but to highlight how I thought about the problems differently depending on the language.</p>

<p>Ruby is a fantastic language.  It would delight and sometimes surprise me with how elegant and natural it was to solve problems.  When I approached the Kata, I found myself thinking, “How can I make this more readable?”.   Ruby never failed to please.</p>

<p>Clojure is also a wonderful language.  One of the things that I really enjoy about it is that it changed that way that I approach problems.  This was particularly evident when I turned to solve the same problem in Ruby that I just had in Clojure.  First and foremost, I thought about the data.  Then about how the data could be transformed.  The transformation isn&rsquo;t like the serial steps that you normally take to hold the data in your hand and bit by bit mold it into the result – like a sculptor with clay.  It is the kind of transformation that takes a rolled ball of yarn and transforms into a beautiful lace pattern.</p>

<p>The closest that I had come to this functional way of thinking was when I was doing some heavy SQL and database work.  I went to a talk by Jay Pipes on MySQL.  I remember him saying that to be really good at SQL, you needed to think in sets.  You couldn&rsquo;t effectively solve the queries with the regular programming for-loop construct.  You needed to think of the sets of data joining and intersecting and the transformations needed to be applied to the data elements.  The same focus on the data seemed to hold true for Clojure too.</p>

<p>I highly recommend both Ruby and Clojure as programming languages.  Each are dynamic, elegant and powerful and a lot of fun.  Next time you sit down to do a Kata, and can&rsquo;t decide what language to use, try them both – and let me know how you think&hellip;</p>

		<p>We took our kids bowling for the first time the other day. I have to admit, that I am not a great bowler. I had only been bowling two or three times in my life previous to that event and I was very thankful that those bumpers were up. The computer program malfunctioned in the final frames of our last game. I realized then, that I really had no idea how to score bowling. Later that night, in my surfing, I came across a reference to the <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata">Bowling Game Kata</a>.</p>

<p>Such Kata serendipity could not be ignored. I decided to implement it in Clojure using defrecords to mimic the object model with Frames and the Game and use STM to keep the state of the Game in an atom. Finally, the unit tests are using <a href="https://github.com/marick/Midje">Midje</a> facts – which has a syntax that I enjoy.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a great learning exercise and as a bonus&hellip; I know how to score a bowling game now!</p>

		<p>In Part 1, we used defrecords to create a vampire slayer named “Buffy” and a few vampires for her to kick around.  Today we are going to use Buffy and her vampires to explore STM (Software Transactional Memory) in Clojure for managing state.</p>

<p>Recap</p>

<pre><code>(defrecord Vampire [name, health])
(def vampire1 (Vampire. "Stu" 50))
(def vampire2 (Vampire. "Vance" 100))
(def vampire3 (Vampire. "Izzy" 75))

(defrecord Slayer [name, weapon])
(def kungfu 25)
(def buffy (Slayer. "Buffy" kungfu))

(defn hit [vampire, hitpoints]
  (- (:health vampire) hitpoints))

;vampires don't fight back but it takes time to kill them
(def combat-time 20)

(defn hit-vampire [vampire, slayer]
  (Thread/sleep (* combat-time 10))
  (assoc vampire :health (hit vampire (:weapon slayer))))

(defn kill-vampire [vampire, slayer]
  (if (&gt; (:health vampire) 1)
    (recur (hit-vampire vampire slayer) slayer)
    (assoc vampire :health 0)))
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take our vampires and stand them up in a line for Buffy to fight.  We are also going to create a function that just has Buffy killing a vampire, rather then a generic slayer.</p>

<pre><code>(def vampire-line [vampire1 vampire2 vampire3])

(defn buffy-kill-vampire [vampire]
  (kill-vampire vampire buffy))
</code></pre>

<p>Test Buffy killing vampire1</p>

<pre><code>(buffy-kill-vampire vampire1)
#:user.Vampire{:name "Stu", :health 0}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can use the map function to apply the buffy-kill-vampire function to every vampire in our vampire line.</p>

<pre><code>(map buffy-kill-vampire vampire-line)
(#:user.Vampire{:name "Stu", :health 0} #:user.Vampire{:name "Vance", :health 0} #:user.Vampire{:name "Izzy", :health 0})
</code></pre>

<p>This is also a good time to bring up pmap (pmap f coll).  The pmap is the same as the map execpt that it applys the function to the collection in parallel.  It is useful when the time to process each function is computationally intensive.  To show the difference between map and pmap let&rsquo;s change the combat-time to be 200ms instead of 20ms and time each way.  We need a dorun to force the function to not be lazy.</p>

<pre><code>(def combat-time 200)

(time (dorun (map buffy-kill-vampire vampire-line)))
"Elapsed time: 18002.67764 msecs"

(time (dorun (pmap buffy-kill-vampire vampire-line)))
"Elapsed time: 8001.808821 msecs
</code></pre>

<p>Now if you notice, even though we have be killing the vampire line over and over again.  They don&rsquo;t stay dead</p>

<pre><code>vampire-line
[#:user.Vampire{:name "Stu", :health 50} #:user.Vampire{:name "Vance", :health 100} #:user.Vampire{:name "Izzy", :health 75}]
</code></pre>

<p>We need to involve some state so that our vampire-line will reflect the health of zero for all of the vampires once Buffy slays them.  In Clojure, state is handled by Software Transactional Memory (STM).  You can use Refs for coordinated and synchronous updates, Atoms for Uncoordinated and Synchronous updates, or Agents for asynchronous updates.  In our example, we are going to use the Atom, since it is lighter weight and we just want to maintain the state of the vampire-line.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s refine the vampire-line as an atom.  We</p>

<pre><code>(def vampire-line (atom [vampire1 vampire2 vampire3]))
</code></pre>

<p>We need to deference it now to know it&rsquo;s value</p>

<pre><code>@vampire-line
[#:user.Vampire{:name "Stu", :health 50} #:user.Vampire{:name "Vance", :health 100} #:user.Vampire{:name "Izzy", :health 75}]
</code></pre>

<p>Now we are going to redefine the buffy-destroy-all-vampires function to use the reset! function to update its value.  We also need to convert the result to a vector before calling reset!  Also note that we need to deference the vampire-line value when call using map.</p>

<pre><code>(defn buffy-destroy-all-vampires []
  (reset! vampire-line (vec (map buffy-kill-vampire @vampire-line))))
</code></pre>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s see what happens when Buffy kills them</p>

<pre><code> @vampire-line
[#:user.Vampire{:name "Stu", :health 0} #:user.Vampire{:name "Vance", :health 0} #:user.Vampire{:name "Izzy", :health 0}]

(buffy-destroy-all-vampires)
[#:user.Vampire{:name "Stu", :health 0} #:user.Vampire{:name "Vance", :health 0} #:user.Vampire{:name "Izzy", :health 0}]

 @vampire-line
[#:user.Vampire{:name "Stu", :health 0} #:user.Vampire{:name "Vance", :health 0} #:user.Vampire{:name "Izzy", :health 0}]
</code></pre>

<p>The vampires are finally dead and staying dead!  Score one for the good guys!</p>
