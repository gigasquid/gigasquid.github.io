		<p>Reading <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/ailogic/ailogic.html">Artificial Intelligence, Logic, and Formalizing Common Sense</a>, led me surprisingly to reflect on, not only logic and philosophy, but also the history and present state of AI.</p>

<p>Fist let&rsquo;s look at the kind of AI that McCarthy is describing in paper. He talks of a program that can use common sense knowledge about the world around it and have this knowledge structured well enough that it can be reasoned about mathematically. In fact, he describes four levels of logic:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> The computer program has its &ldquo;beliefs&rdquo; completely defined by its internal state.  If you are confused by the term &ldquo;beliefs&rdquo;, it refers to <a href="http://gigasquidsoftware.com/blog/2012/09/20/7-john-mccarthy-papers-in-7-weeks-1/">ascribing mental qualities to machines</a>.  In his famous example, a thermostat has three beliefs: the room is too hot, the room is too cold, and the room is just right.</p></li>
<li><p> The programs express their beliefs in sentences in machine memory.  However, they do not use ordinary logic.  They use other methods like rules and procedures.</p></li>
<li><p> In addition to expresses their beliefs in sentences, they also use first order logic and logical deduction to reach their conclusions.</p></li>
<li><p> The fourth level is still a goal today.  It is to have the program represent general facts about the world as logical sentences.  Furthermore, to have a database of these commonsense facts that programs can share.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Let&rsquo;s step back now for a moment, to a excerpt from the very beginning of the paper:</p>

<blockquote><p>One path to human-level AI uses mathematical logic to formalize common-sense knowledge in such a way that common-sense problems can be solved by logical reasoning. This methodology requires understanding the common-sense world well enough to formalize facts about it and ways of achieving goals in it. Basing AI on understanding the common-sense world is different from basing it on understanding human psychology or neurophysiology.</p></blockquote>

<p>This approach to AI is just one approach. It is commonly referred to as a &ldquo;top down&rdquo; approach.  In the early years of AI it was the dominant way of thinking about things. Looking back at the history of AI, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#The_golden_years_1956.E2.88.921974">golden years</a> were full of optimism, (and funding), that this was the path to achieving fully intelligent machines.  Disenchantment with unfulfilled promises, led to the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">AI winter</a>.  There was a rise of expert systems later on that limited their scope to small domains and avoided the common sense problem, but eventually ended in a second AI winter and ushered in our current world.  This basic approach is an opposite ground-up view of AI.  It uses neural networks and statistics from a physical inspiration.  Some of this inspiration is from human neurophysiology, some of it is from insect and animal world, but simplicity behavior of a &ldquo;body&rdquo; is emphasized.  With the advances in hardware and computing power today, the innovations and accomplishments have been breath taking.</p>

<p>A good example of the two approaches can be seen in my Roomba.  A top down approach, would require my Roomba to have a complete room model in its program.  It would have to understand what my couch was, where the doors where and have logically reasoning to direct it to which areas to clean and when to stop cleaning and recharge itself.  The creators of the Roomba were from the opposite camp of thinking.  They took the simpler behavior approach of having the Roomba just take a random walk in the room and turn around when it ran into an obstacle.  It took a bit longer to get the room clean in such a random fashion, but not having to deal with the overhead of a mental model was well worth the trade off.</p>

<p>Noam Chomsky recently argued that the<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/noam-chomsky-on-where-artificial-intelligence-went-wrong/261637/"> pendulum has swung too far in favor of this simplified behaviorist approach</a>. Even in the light of <a href="http://norvig.com/chomsky.html">Norvig&rsquo;s response</a>, I think Chomsky has a point.  We would do well to search for gems of true intelligent systems in the historical landscape of the AI Winter.  Some of the breakthroughs of current sheer computing power and new modeling techniques, might yield great fruits.</p>

<p>One of the comments by nagelonce, on the Chomsky article,  puts this very well:</p>

<blockquote><p>AI has a hole in the middle. There&rsquo;s top-down AI, which focuses on abstractions and reductionism. There&rsquo;s bottom-up AI, which focuses on reactive systems and the front end of visual processing. They have yet to meet in the middle. They are, however, much closer to doing so than they were twenty years ago.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you are interested in checking out a top-down open source AI project, take a look at <a href="http://www.opencyc.org/doc">OpenCyc</a>.  After a brief look at it the other night, it suffers from the lack of love and documentation.  But, I can also see the promise of McCarthy&rsquo;s common sense knowledge and logic system, covered in a thin layer of snow.</p>

		<p><strong>In which I realize that John McCarthy is the father of the Semantic Web</strong></p>

<p>I have realized that it generally takes me more than a week to read a paper, reflect on it, experiment, and finally blog about it. But, since I made up the rules of the project in the first place,  I am not going to dwell on the time frame and just move forward with the next paper.</p>

<p>When I picked the paper <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131014084908/http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/concepts/concepts.html">First Order Theories of Individual Concepts and Propositions</a>, I thought to myself that it would be a rather narrow, more self contained paper than the first two broad papers that I read. However, the connections that it drew to current technologies caught me by surprise.</p>

<p>The main point of the paper is how to formalize language statements, including concepts, so that a computer can apply mathematical rules and logic to them. McCarthy had mentioned concepts and thoughts in his &ldquo;Ascribing Mental Qualities&rdquo; paper, where he says:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;..the deep structure&rdquo; of a publicly expressible thought is a node is the public network.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>This immediately brought to my mind the Semantic Web.   In Semantic Web, data is structured in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/#statements">RDF</a> statements as triples &ndash; <subject> <predicate> <object>.  The data contained in these triples are structured and described so that machines can derive context and meaning from it.  For example, instead of just putting  &#8221;cat&#8221; as the subject.  In RDF you would use <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat">http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat</a> as the subject. Which, is pretty much dead on McCarthy&rsquo;s expressible thought as a node in the public network.</p>

<p>McCarthy uses the following example to illustrate how to construct First Order statements.</p>

<blockquote><p>Frege (1892) discussed the need to distinguish direct and indirect use of words. According to one interpretation of Frege&rsquo;s ideas, the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;Mike&rsquo;s telephone number&rdquo; in the sentence &ldquo;Pat knows Mike&rsquo;s telephone number&rdquo; is the concept of Mike&rsquo;s telephone number, whereas its meaning in the sentence &ldquo;Pat dialed Mike&rsquo;s telephone number&rdquo; is the number itself. Thus if we also have Mary&rsquo;s telephone number = Mike&rsquo;s telephone number&#8221;, then Pat dialed Mary&#8217;s telephone number&#8221; follows, but &ldquo;Pat knows Mary&rsquo;s telephone number does not. phone number&rdquo; is the number itself. Thus if we also have Mary&rsquo;s telephone number = Mike&rsquo;s telephone number&#8221;, then Pat dialed Mary&#8217;s telephone number&#8221; follows, but Pat knows Mary&rsquo;s telephone number does not.</p></blockquote>

<p>McCarthy express the statement &ldquo;Pat knows Mike&rsquo;s telephone number&rdquo; as:</p>

<blockquote><p>true Know(Pat; Telephone Mike)</p></blockquote>

<p>He then uses more formalized statements to derive logic statements and reasoning from this example.</p>

<p>At this point, I was seeing more connections to the field of Semantic Web. Expressing data in RDF/ OWL gives computers exactly this type of logic and reasoning ability too.</p>

<p>So how would you go about expressing &ldquo;Pat knows Mike&rsquo;s telephone number&rdquo; in Semantic Web data form?   This question is not a simple one,(at least for me),  because there are so many different ways that you can construct RDF.  The choices were a bit overwhelming.</p>

<p>One option might be to use RDF reification, in which you can make statements about statements.  Another option might be using OWL classes and properties.  There are some excellent answers when I posed the question on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13114018/how-to-state-pat-knows-mikes-telephone-number-in-rdf-owl">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13114018/how-to-state-pat-knows-mikes-telephone-number-in-rdf-owl.</a></p>

<p>Indeed, it seems that we can express individual concepts and propositions in Semantic Web form quite well.  I had not realized that John McCarthy is the father of Sematic Web as well.</p>

<p>In closing, he speaks of AI Applications. Reasoning and predication are familiar applications that we use today. However he hits upon one that is quite interesting to me. That is &ldquo;..determining that it <strong>does not know </strong>something or that someone else doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; This is not a common area to think about with computer programs. We are usually much more focused on what it does know and how to reason about it. But, if we are really to build intelligent, learning systems, we need to be able to identify what it does not know as well.  Perhaps then the AI can help us humans, who are pretty bad at that too.</p>

    </div>
		<p>Well, life threw me for a bit of a loop and delayed my post on my second paper. So I am going to consider this a &ldquo;weekish&rdquo; period of time and just continue on.</p>

<p>I read <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131014084908/http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/towards/towards.html"> Towards a Mathematical Science of Computation</a>.  It is quite a meaty paper and was certainly a lot to digest.  Here are some highlights that I gleaned from it.</p>

<h3>How can a Mathematical Science of Computation help in a practical way?</h3>

<p>McCarthy points out that while it is hard to predict practical applications ahead of time.  A couple of could be</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Provide a systematic way to create of programming language.  Rather than just arguing and arbitrarily adding language features whilly nilly.</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;It should be possible to eliminate debugging.  Debugging is the testing of a program on cases one hopes are typical, until it seems to work.  This frequently is in vain.&rdquo;</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This last point of being able to eliminate debugging really stuck with me.  Even with the best of TDD and test suites, we as developers still struggle with the testing of programs against what we hope is &ldquo;typical&rdquo;.  Over the past years we have improved our techniques and made our programs more robust, but it would certainly be nice to be able to prove a program correct.</p>

<p>If fear that even if this was possible, it would not be enough. At least in my experience, a considerable amount of debugging happens at the human level:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The translation of understanding of what the human product owner wants to what the software developer can understand.</p></li>
<li><p>The human product owner&rsquo;s understanding of what they want in the first place.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In my experience, we have just as much trouble (or even more) stating the problem for the program as we do in attempting to solve and prove that it works.</p>

<h3>What we already know that can be applied to a Mathematical Science of Computation</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The existence of Turing&rsquo;s Universal computers</p></li>
<li><p>The existence of classes of unsolvable problems</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Perhaps a sonic screwdriver will help?</h3>

<p>McCarthy then goes on to add another tool to the Mathematical Science of computation toolbox. He shows that conditional expressions can be defined recursively.  Then he expands this to relate to programs/computers that can be defined recursively.</p>

<h3>Can a man make a computer program that is as intelligent as him?</h3>

<p>Here is the real question.  McCarthy has us consider the following problem of whether a program on a computers with unlimited memory will ever stop:</p>

<p>A procedure does the following</p>

<ol>
<li><p> If the number is in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_and_productive_sets">creative set</a> then return &ndash;> yes.
If a number is not in a creative set then return &ndash;> no
or it may run indefinitely</p></li>
<li><p> There is no procedure while will always return &ndash;> yes when the answer is yes.  and return &ndash;> no when the answer is no</p></li>
</ol>


<p>It is a bit depressing that we can&rsquo;t figure out which ones that are really no and which ones run forever.  But don&rsquo;t give up.  We can just try to do the best we can.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Leon_Post">Emil Post</a> discovered that whenever we try to do the best we can, one can always improve upon it.  He showed that given any procedure, he could make a new procedure that solved all the previous cases plus some new ones. McCarthy pointed out that this process, even though it is really like trying to count the biggest ordinal number, can be mechanized.  So really there is no reason why a machine could not continually improve its own program.</p>

<p>In summary, McCarthy&rsquo;s own words are the best:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In conclusion, let me re-assert that the question of whether there are limitations in principle of what problems man can make machines solve for him as compared to his own ability to solve problems, really is a technical question in recursive function theory.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<h2>Ascribing Mental Qualities to Machines or How My Thermostat has Beliefs and Goals</h2>

<p>After reading John McCarthy&rsquo;s paper this week <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131014084908/http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/">Ascribing Mental Qualities to Machines</a>, I can honestly say that it has changed the way I think about programs and most certainly thermostats. For you see, I realize now that my thermostat has beliefs and goals. No, it does not have beliefs about what the weather is going to be tomorrow, or when the next George R.R. Martin book is going to come out. But it does have beliefs. It has three of them to be exact:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The room is too hot</p></li>
<li><p>The room is too cold</p></li>
<li><p>The room is OK</p></li>
</ul>


<p>It also only has one goal:</p>

<ul>
<li>The room should be OK</li>
</ul>


<h3>Wat?</h3>

<p>Why should we think of a simple thermostat this way? It is not very complex. In fact, we can completely understand its state and reason about its behavior by looking at its small and complete program listing. What benefit can there possibly be to endow the humble thermostat with its own beliefs and goals?</p>

<h3>Start Small</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s step back. We are talking about designing and building intelligent systems, not just programs. The example of a thermostat is indeed small, but let us try out our ideas on a easy to understand system first. Later we can consider applying it to more complex systems.</p>

<h3>Beliefs and Goals are Easier to Understand and Reason About</h3>

<p>Using a higher level construct to express state can make it easier to reason and understand intelligent systems. It also is useful in describing states that are not completely known or have portions that are not easily observable. In short, defining a program&rsquo;s state in terms of beliefs and goals may be closer to our natural way of thinking. When I consider my co-worker sitting next to me. I cannot hope to observe the complete mental state of him at that moment. Although I could hope to describe it at a high level with beliefs and goals. I could even hope to predict future behavior with this knowledge of his beliefs and goals, (which most likely has to do with the goal of eating more bacon).</p>

<h3>Easier to Debug and Correct</h3>

<p>Once we have a higher level model of a systems mental state and behavior. It would be easier to debug, communicate, and correct problems. For example, If I come home and the room is way too cold, I could look for the problem in terms of beliefs and goals. Does the thermostat have a faulty belief? Or did it have a good belief that the room was too cold? If so, then the problem was that it could not act on its belief to tell the furnace to turn on. If it could communicate and know the problem, perhaps it could message me and I could arrange a service call, or it could even self-correct. Another example, is my recent experience with my Roomba. I came home the other day to find my Roomba had not returned to its charging station after its scheduled cleaning. Instead, it was stopped under my bed. What went wrong? Did it believe that the battery was low? Or was there some other faulty belief? It would be nice if it could tell me.</p>

<h3>Delving Further &ndash; What is a belief?</h3>

<p>McCarthy talks about defining a belief as a function of the system&rsquo;s state. For each state, there are beliefs that can be expressed as a sentences in a language. The machine does not need to understand the meaning and concepts in the English, French or any given language. That is for us to interpret. The important part is that there is a mapping of the state to this sentence. Taking our humble thermostat for an example:</p>

<pre><code>(defn thermo-belief [temp]
  (cond
    (&gt; temp 70) "The room is too hot."
    (&lt; temp 70) "The room is too cold."
    :else "The room is OK."))
</code></pre>

<p>We can test our thermostats beliefs with something like:</p>

<pre><code>(deftest thermo-beliefs-tests
  (is (= "The room is too hot." (thermo-belief 71)))
  (is (= "The room is too cold." (thermo-belief 69)))
  (is (= "The room is OK." (thermo-belief 70))))
</code></pre>

<p>This testing or criticizing the belief structure of the thermostat is what McCarthy called a Second Order Structural definition for mental qualities. This differs from a First Order Structural definition in that, rather than criticizing or testing an individual belief, he sought to describe them by testing/ criticizing the structure of the whole set of beliefs.</p>

<p>In the example of our thermostat, to have a &ldquo;good&rdquo; belief structure, in accordance with Second Order Structural definition, it the must have some consequences or actions of it beliefs. Furthermore, these actions most be consistent with its goals.</p>

<p>It might be expressed in code like this:</p>

<pre><code>(defn thermo-action [belief temp]
  (case belief
    "The room is too hot." (dec temp)
    "The room is too cold." (inc temp)
    "The room is ok." temp))
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the action of a belief is returning a new state, the temperature. Our thermostat could issue a command to the furnace to turn on. But, let us keep it simple for the moment and just think of its action directly changing the temperature. Now, our believing thermostat program can be described as having beliefs as well as taking actions from them.</p>

<pre><code>(defn thermostat [temp]
  (thermo-action (thermo-belief temp) temp))

(thermostat 33) ;=&gt; 34
</code></pre>

<p>So now we have a thermostat that has beliefs and consequences from these beliefs. We still need to figure out how to test that its belief system is consistent with its goals. Thankfully, it only has one goal to keep it simple. The goal is that the room should be OK.</p>

<pre><code>(def goal 70)
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say that the thermostat is doing what it believes will achieve its goals, if the new temperature is closer to its goal.</p>

<pre><code>(defn distance-from-goal [g t]
  (Math/abs (- g t)))

(distance-from-goal goal 80) ;=&gt; 10

(defn closer-to-goal [g t nt]
  (&gt; (distance-from-goal g t)
    (distance-from-goal g nt)))

(closer-to-goal goal 75 73) ;=&gt; true
(closer-to-goal goal 75 76) ;=&gt; false
(closer-to-goal goal 56 57) ;=&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>We can now construct a test to see if the thermostat actions are consistent with its goals.</p>

<pre><code>(deftest themo-behavior-test
  (is (closer-to-goal goal 4 (thermostat 4)))
  (is (closer-to-goal goal 74 (thermostat 74)))
  (is (closer-to-goal goal 75 (thermostat 75)))
  (is (closer-to-goal goal 56 (thermostat 56))))
</code></pre>

<p>Given this particular thermostat example, we could even recursively show that it will reach its goal:</p>

<pre><code>(defn thermo-simulation [g s]
(if (= g s) "Woo hoo!"
(thermo-simulation g (thermostat s))))

(thermo-simulation goal 73) ;=&gt;; "Woo hoo!"

(deftest thermo-goal-achievement-test
(is (= "Woo hoo!" (thermo-simulation goal 73)))
(is (= "Woo hoo!" (thermo-simulation goal 100)))
(is (= "Woo hoo!" (thermo-simulation goal 33)))
(is (= "Woo hoo!" (thermo-simulation goal -33))) )
</code></pre>

<p>Our thermostat&rsquo;s beliefs are good!</p>

<h3>What if &hellip;.</h3>

<p>The way that McCarthy explains the Second Order Structural definition as criticizing and testing beliefs, made me start thinking about test driven design. What if we were to start thinking and designing our programs with this testing of belief and goal structure? It could be IDD (Intelligence Driven Design) rather than TDD/ BDD. From experience, I know that TDD has changed the way that I think about coding and resulted in cleaner and more robust programs. I wonder what effect IDD could have on our program&rsquo;s creation and perhaps the future of AI. Could changing the way we approach our definition of state and behavior change our software to become more intelligent? Wait a minute. If we write a test system to criticize another programs beliefs and goals, wouldn&rsquo;t we be designing a program that would have beliefs about another program&rsquo;s beliefs?</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>My brain get exploded.
It is in fact, turtles all the way down :)</p>

</div>
    </div>
		<p>In the spirit of <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks">Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</a>, I have decided to embark on a quest. But instead of focusing on expanding my mindset with different programming languages, I am focusing on trying to get into the mindset of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist">John McCarthy</a>), father of LISP and AI, by reading and thinking about seven of his <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131014084908/http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/">papers</a>.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<h4>Get out of your box</h4>

<p>If you are comfortable, you are not challenging yourself to grow.  You are doomed to stay in your same mindset and your little box and your world gets smaller.  As an Object Oriented programmer, I was happy in my little box.  Then one day, I discovered Clojure and Functional Programming and my world became bigger and richer because of it.  I hope to glean a similar box expansion, by exploring the thoughts of McCarthy.  Especially, since I have the nagging suspicion that we are somehow doing programming <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/john-mccarthy-programming-wrong.jpg">&ldquo;completely wrong.&rdquo;</a></p>

<h4>Slow Down</h4>

<p>Reading papers is an antidote to today&rsquo;s relentless stream of Twitter and Hacker News techno stuff.  It forces you to slow down and read something &hellip;gasp, maybe even the same thing multiple times and digest it.  Thinking slow and eating more veggies is something we could all do more.</p>

<h4>Structure</h4>

<p>Following a somewhat arbitrary schedule of seven papers in seven weeks gives a structure that gives an measurable goal and timeline to this endeavor.  Which gives you a fighting chance of actually getting it accomplished.</p>

<h4>The Answer is Never Too Far Away</h4>

<p>When we are presented with a problem, more often then not, the answer comes to us  from some of our recent thoughts and experiences. Many breakthroughs in new technologies have come from cross pollination across different fields.  Exposing yourself to a new ways of thinking gives your creative problem solving abilities new and powerful ammunition.</p>

<h4>Encourage Others</h4>

<p>Serendipity moves in mysterious ways.  By sharing your travels and thoughts, who knows what might spark in someone else&rsquo;s mind&hellip;</p>

<p>So I encourage you to join along.  Pick a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131014084908/http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/">paper</a> that appeals to you and read it this week. Think about it, talk to your co-workers about it, maybe write about it, or even code from it.  But most importantly, slow down and take a moment to peek outside your box.</p>

One of the things that I love about Clojure is that it can go anywhere that Java can.  That is why, when I found out that the Roomba already had a <a href="http://hackingroomba.com/code/roombacomm/">Java library</a> written for it &ndash; I was excited to be able to hook it up to my Emacs / Swank and be able to control it from my editor.</p>

<p>It is great fun!  If you have a Roomba at home and you want to play along&hellip;</p>

		<p>I love Roomba. It cleans our floors and it can be <a href="http://www.irobot.com/images/consumer/hacker/roomba_sci_spec_manual.pdf">hacked</a> to help teach my kids programming. Win!</p>

<p>Here are the setup steps that I used to get going talking to Roomba:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ordered a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10980?">Rootooth</a> bluetooth connection for Roomba.  I could have build one from <a href="http://hackingroomba.com/projects/build-a-roomba-bluetooth-adapter/">scratch</a>, but I am a busy mom and hacker.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed the cover from Roomba to expose the ROI port (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZibdOIeD0">Video</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Setup the Bluetooth adapter on my Mac</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Start Bluetooth network assistant</p></li>
<li><p>Have the firefly adapter deteted</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the passkey: 1234</p></li>
<li><p>Click edit serial ports to see what port it assigned.  Mine was FireFly-943A-SPP.  Alternatively, you can look at /dev directory</p></li>
<li><p>Next, you need to configure the baud rate for your Roomba. I found these <a href="http://www.robotappstore.com/Knowledge-Base/3-Serial-Port-Baud-Rate-Configuration/17.html">instructions</a> helpful</p></li>
<li><p>Install zterm on your mac  - set the serial port to your roomba and the baud rate to the correct baud rate</p></li>
<li><p>On zterm you now should be able to echo any key you type</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Download<a href="http://hackingroomba.com/code/roombacomm/"> RoombaComm</a> java package</p></li>
<li><p>Look at the README.  You will need to run makeit.sh to build and ./rxtxlib/macosx_setup.command (for Macs)</p></li>
<li><p>Finally run RoombaCommTest.sh to connect up and control your Roomba!</p></li>
</ul>

		<p><img src="http://www.thebells.net/Halloween/BabaYaga/BabaYaga3.GIF" alt="Baba Yaga's House" /></p>

<p>Once upon a time, a young girl decided to take a break from her code and stroll in the forest.  It was quite a pleasant day, she packed her lunch in her bag and set off.  While she was walking, she started thinking about a concurrency bug that her OO project was having.  As she pondered the complexities of mutablilty, state, and threads, she must of strayed from the trail and lost track of time.  By the time she looked around, she realized that she was totally lost.</p>

<p>It was then she spotted a very strange hut on chicken legs in the middle of the forest.  The door was open, and there was a ladder leading up to it.  She yelled &ldquo;Hello&rdquo;, but there was no response.  She climbed up the ladder and entered the hut to see if she could find anyone inside.  The hut was empty except for a pile of old books, a large kettle, and very skinny, malnourished black cat. Her heart went out to the poor cat.  She took her sandwich from her bag and watched as the cat greedily ate it.  The cat looked up at her and said, &ldquo;Thank you for your kindness.  Now, you should really get out of her before Baba Yaga &hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A large gust of wind came at the door and Baba Yaga appeared.  She smiled an iron tooth grin at the girl and said, &ldquo;What do we have here? An intruder!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The girl stammered out, &ldquo;I am sorry, it is just a mistake.  I am lost ..&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too late!&rdquo; Baba Yaga grinned larger.  &ldquo;You are now my slave and if you don&rsquo;t complete my tasks, I will eat you for my supper.&rdquo; She thought for a moment and then pulled a book titled <em>The Odyssey</em> from the pile.  &ldquo;Your first task is to calculate the hash code of every character this book. Then sum of the values of only the even ones.  Make sure you have it done before I return.  And do it fast, I will be timing you.&rdquo;  Baba Yaga turned and disappeared in a gust of wind, with the door slamming and locking firmly in place behind her.</p>

<p>The girl sunk to the floor and started to weep.  How could she complete the task?  The cat rubbed up against her and purred, &ldquo;You showed kindess to me where Baba Yaga never has. I will help you. It seems like this task would be best suited to a Clojure map, filter, and reduce, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl wiped her eyes. &ldquo;Cat, I think you are right.&rdquo;  She picked up the book.  &ldquo;The first thing we need is to get the content of this book into a vector.&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>(def odyssey-text (vec (slurp "odyssey.txt")))
(class odyssey-text) ;=&gt; java.lang.PersistentVector
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;The vector contains all the characters.  See, we can grab the first one and find its hash code this way.&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>(first odyssey-text) ;=&gt; \P
(class (first odyssey-text)) ;=&gt; java.lang.Character
(.hashCode (first odyssey-text)) ;=&gt; 80
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;Now, all we need to do is to make a function to find the hash code and map it to the entire string.&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>(defn hashcode [c] (.hashCode c))
(map hashcode odyssey-text) ;=&gt; (80 114 ..... )
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;Next, we need to filter only the even ones out.&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>(defn hashcode [c] (.hashCode c))
(map hashcode odyssey-text) ;=&gt; (80 114 111..... )
(filter even? (map hashcode odyssey-text)) ;=&gt; (80 114 ... )
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;Finally, we just need to sum all these values up with reduce.&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>(reduce + (filter even? (map hashcode odyssey-text))) ;=&gt; 33702446
</code></pre>

<p>As soon as she had gotten her answer, Baba Yaga appeared back through the door.  &ldquo;Well, you seemed to have found the answer.  But, let&rsquo;s see how long it took you.&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>(dotimes [n 5]
  (println (str "map - filter - reduce - ( run " n " ):"))
  (time (reduce + (filter even? (map hashcode odyssey-text)))))
       ;=&gt; map - filter - reduce - ( run 0 ):
       ;   "Elapsed time: 6932.227 msecs"
       ;   map - filter - reduce - ( run 1 ):
       ;   "Elapsed time: 5433.219 msecs"
       ;   map - filter - reduce - ( run 2 ):
       ;   "Elapsed time: 5157.45 msecs"
       ;   map - filter - reduce - ( run 3 ):
       ;   "Elapsed time: 5397.058 msecs"
       ;   map - filter - reduce - ( run 4 ):
       ;   "Elapsed time: 5224.334 msecs"
</code></pre>

<p>Baba Yaga chuckled &ldquo;Have it done again in under 5 seconds by the time I return.  I am getting hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl starting sobbing again. &ldquo;How am I supposed to make it faster?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cat calmly cleaned himself and said &ldquo;I have heard that Clojure has a new Reducers library that allows you to do composable, parallel, reducible functions like mapping and filtering.  Try this in the namespace.&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>(ns reducers.core
  (:require [clojure.core.reducers :as r]))
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;The new parallel versions of map and filter have the exact same shape as the regular versions.  So all we need to do is use the new reducer versions.&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>(r/fold + (r/filter even? (r/map hashcode odyssey-text))) ;=&gt; 33702446
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;But, is it faster?  The girl hoped.&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>        ;=&gt;   r/map - r/filter - r/fold - ( run 0 ):
        ;     "Elapsed time: 4702.766 msecs"
        ;     r/map - r/filter - r/fold - ( run 1 ):
        ;     "Elapsed time: 4617.575 msecs"
        ;     r/map - r/filter - r/fold - ( run 2 ):
        ;     "Elapsed time: 4596.329 msecs"
        ;     r/map - r/filter - r/fold - ( run 3 ):
        ;     "Elapsed time: 4636.259 msecs"
        ;     r/map - r/filter - r/fold - ( run 4 ):
        ;     "Elapsed time: 4572.804 msecs"
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Baba Yaga stormed in the room.  &ldquo;Cat!  You helped her!  You mangy thing. Get out of here!&rdquo;  She shoved the cat out the door.  &ldquo;Let me look at that.  I don&rsquo;t believe it. I want to see the all the filtered hash values for myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cat peeked around the corner and spoke softly to the girl. &ldquo;Luckily, <em>into</em> uses reduce.&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>(into [] (r/filter even? (r/map hashcode odyssey-text))) ;=&gt; [80 114 ... ]
</code></pre>

<p>While Baba Yaga was intently inspecting all the values in the vector, the cat motioned to the girl to slip out the door.  Once outside, she grabbed the cat in her arms and ran as fast and as far away as she could.  She was relieved to finally reach her home safely.  Where she and cat lived happily for ever after writing Clojure code.</p>

		<p>Do you need to have a specific version of Clojure in your leiningen project that you can&rsquo;t get from Clojars?</p>

<p>I ran into this problem when I wanted to run a sample project on Clojure&rsquo;s reducers &ndash; which is not in the current Clojars version of 1.4.0.  I needed to use the most recent version, (unreleased), of 1.5.0.  These are the steps to get you running.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Clone the <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/">clojure git repository </a></p></li>
<li><p>In the project directory &ndash; run ant to build the jar</p></li>
<li><p>Install the jar into your local maven repo</p></li>
</ul>


<p><code>mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.clojure -DartifactId=clojure -Dfile=clojure-1.5.0-master-SNAPSHOT.jar -DpomFile=pom.xml</code></p>

<ul>
<li>Now you can update your lein project.clj with</li>
</ul>


<p><code>(defproject reducers "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
:description "FIXME: write description"
:dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.5.0-master-SNAPSHOT"]])</code>
Run lein deps and you should be all set.</p>

<p>This trick also works with running leiningen projects with<a href="http://datomic.com/"> Datomic</a>.  In this case &ndash; download the Datomic library and from the root directory run
<code> mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.datomic -DartifactId=datomic -Dfile=datomic-0.1.3164.jar -DpomFile=pom.xml</code></p>

<p><strong><strong><strong><em> Update </em></strong></strong></strong>
I found out that there is already an alpha version of Clojure on Maven.  So you don&rsquo;t need to do the build.  <a href="http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.clojure/clojure/1.5.0-alpha2">http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.clojure/clojure/1.5.0-alpha2</a></p>

<p>It would simply be
<code>(defproject reducers "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "FIXME: write description"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.5.0-alpha2"]])</code></p>
