<p>Here we see the <a href="http://www.trossenrobotics.com/phantomx-ax-hexapod.aspx">PhantomX Hexapod</a> thriving in the natural habitat of a
cozy, climate controlled, modern house. But there was a time before
the hexapod.  In particular, there was a time of many hexapod parts
and a high level software developer that somehow, despite her natural
lack of mechanical skills, managed to bring it to life. This blog post
endeavors to chronicle the high and low points of this journey. And
perhaps, will make it easier for any other brave souls that would like
to bring the <em>Age of Hexapods</em> into their homes.</p>

<h2>Oh My! So Many Parts</h2>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t really mentally prepared for the vast amounts of parts in the
kit.  Here is a sampling:</p>

<ul>
<li>18 AX-12A Servos</li>
<li>Top/ Bottom Body Plate</li>
<li>20 Brackets</li>
<li>Arbotix Board</li>
<li>2 Xbees</li>
<li>Lipo Battery &amp; Charger</li>
<li>Arbotix programmer</li>
<li>19 Cables</li>
<li><strong>50,000 nuts and screws </strong> (Really only about 850 &ndash; but you get my
 point)</li>
</ul>


<h2>First Things First</h2>

<p>The very first thing to do is to make sure that you have all the
parts.  Once I went through the checklist and double counted all my
screws, I was relieved to go onto the next task of programming the
Arbotix and assign ids to servos and center them. These steps
consisted of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Getting the Arduino IDE going</li>
<li>Loading the Drivers and Libraries</li>
<li>Loading the ROS (Robot Operating System) on the Arbotix Board, so
that it could be used to program the servos.</li>
</ul>


<p>Each of the servos have to be assigned a number. This will let the
program know which part of the leg is which, so that it will
eventually &ndash; hopefully, be able to walk. Once the id is given, a
sticker is labeled on the servo for future use. Centering the servos
is a VERY important step not to overlook.  If you do not center the
servos, you will get into the unfortunate circumstance of having to
dissemble the robot, cry, recenter the servos, and then reassemble the
robot. Please avoid.</p>

<h2>Putting It Together</h2>

<p>The assembly starts with the feet and legs first.
I was so pleased when I got the feet assembled, that I considered
knitting little baby hexapod booties.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7298/13278059445_562bb9ce4b.jpg"></p>

<p>Next a servo and the tibia is added</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7311/13278197583_599f030bab.jpg"></p>

<p>Another servo and the tibia and femur is assembled</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7185/13278392294_8986c14e5b.jpg"></p>

<p>Finally, another servo and the whole leg is assembled</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7033/13278197683_cfd9a4870f.jpg"></p>

<h2>Newbie Advice</h2>

<p>I would like to pause for a minute to share some advice from my trial
and errors in assembly thus far:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t overtighten screws </strong> &ndash; More is not better. It makes things
like plexiglass frames crack and break.</li>
<li><strong>Seating nuts in servos is hard</strong> &ndash; This isn&rsquo;t really advice. Just
moral support in your struggle.  There are 18 servos and up to 20
nuts to seat in each servo.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3833/13278059175_91699a9704_n.jpg"></p>

<h2>Assembling the body</h2>

<p>The body is where the board, battery and and cables go.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3755/13278197953_44717aea96.jpg"></p>

<p>At long last, the legs can be attached to the body &ndash; with 120 screws
of course.</p>

<h2>Round two of Newbie Advice</h2>

<ul>
<li>For those who have never stripped wires and attached them to power
supplies, like me, please mind that the wires are twisted so that
the edges don&rsquo;t fray out and short out everything requiring you to
re-assign all the servos that lost their ids and much unscrewing,
crying, and reassembling.</li>
<li>When programming the Arbotix board.  You must remove the Xbee, or it
will not work.</li>
<li>Also, did I mention not over-tightening screws? Also, the order in
which you tighten the screws is important too.  Try to tighten them
all loosely in order, so you don&rsquo;t stress the fiberglass parts and
have something like this happen.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3749/13278392754_cde8d9e10f_n.jpg"></p>

<h2>It is Alive!</h2>

<p>Finally, the moment of truth. The hexapod is assembled and it is time
to upload a test check on the board to make sure that everything is
working alright.</p>

<div class="ratio-4-3 embed-video-container" onclick="var myAnchor = document.getElementById('i9St8kDuyqU');var tmpDiv = document.createElement('div');tmpDiv.innerHTML = '&lt;iframe style=&quot;vertical-align:top;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/i9St8kDuyqU?autoplay=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;';myAnchor.parentNode.replaceChild(tmpDiv.firstChild, myAnchor);return false;" title="click here to play">

<div class="youtube-lazy-link-div"></div>
<div class="youtube-lazy-link-info"></div>
</a>
<div class="video-info" ></div>
</div>


<h2>Walking with Hexapods</h2>

<p>The kit comes with a commander that you assemble of course.  You can
use it to control the hexapod with hand-held joysticks.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3698/13278059985_f5b5c01819_n.jpg"></p>

<p>The moment of truth, when it finally took its very first steps, and the Age of Hexapods began.</p>

<div class="ratio-4-3 embed-video-container" onclick="var myAnchor = document.getElementById('pUrZeJ39xjs');var tmpDiv = document.createElement('div');tmpDiv.innerHTML = '&lt;iframe style=&quot;vertical-align:top;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/pUrZeJ39xjs?autoplay=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;';myAnchor.parentNode.replaceChild(tmpDiv.firstChild, myAnchor);return false;" title="click here to play">
<a class="youtube-lazy-link" style="width:100%;height:100%;background:#000 url(http://i2.ytimg.com/vi/pUrZeJ39xjs/0.jpg) center center no-repeat;background-size:contain;position:absolute" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUrZeJ39xjs" id="pUrZeJ39xjs" onclick="return false;">
<div class="youtube-lazy-link-div"></div>
<div class="youtube-lazy-link-info"></div>
</a>

<p>You don&rsquo;t really understand how important someone is in your life
until they are suddenly gone. I have had the honor and privilege of
working, playing, and laughing alongside Jim Weirich for the last few
years.  He was an amazing man.  I miss him dearly.</p>

<h2>Think</h2>

<p>Jim taught us how to think about computer programming. I once had a
Physics professor tell me not to worry so
much about the formulas and math. The most important thing was how to
<strong>think</strong>.
Everything thing after that would
naturally fall into place.  Jim embodied that philosophy for
programming.  The languages and algorithms poured almost
effortlessly from his masterful fingers.  He knew how to <strong>think</strong> about
the problem, observe from a multitude of angles.  Finally, bringing his
experience, creativity, and humility to bear on it, he would shape it into
a beautiful piece of code.</p>

<h2>Make</h2>

<p>Jim showed us how to make. He was a master craftsman and a maker. The
care and joy that infused his work was inspiring.  He loved the
process of Test Driven Development. Green tests were always a
celebration. The surprise of beautiful code emerging from a
refactoring was treated as a gift.  He is best known for his
<a href="https://github.com/jimweirich/rake">Rake</a> build tool, but his testing
library <a href="https://github.com/jimweirich/rspec-given">rspec-given</a> is
one that reminds me most of him and the way that he loved to craft code.</p>

<h2>Care</h2>

<p>Jim showed us how to care.  Jim cared deeply about each and every
person.  While flying his drone in the office hallway, he would wave
down a passing building maintenance worker and ask if they wanted to
fly it.  Over the course of the next few minutes, Jim would put them
completely at ease and chat happily with them.  He was like that to
<strong>everyone</strong>.  In the few days after
his passing, many building workers, and people from other offices, that
I only ever nodded at in passing, stopped by to give their sincere
condolences his loss. He is without a doubt, the kindest person I have
ever known.  He took great joy in his faith and in his family.  He
would talk about his family all the time and how much they enjoyed
each others company.  He is without a doubt, one of the personally richest men I have ever known.</p>

<h2>Share</h2>

<p>Jim taught us how to share. Jim wanted to share his knowledge.  He was
a great teacher and presenter. He gave engaging presentations that
took people on a journey with him, not only imparting knowledge, but
becoming friends with him in the process.  He was a pillar in the local
Cincinnati technical community. He is the reason why myself and
countless others were drawn to Ruby and the Ruby community.</p>

<h2>Dream</h2>

<p>Jim dreamed with us.  He was a creative. He was also a singer, song
writer, musician, and artist.  He brought that creative spirit,
curiosity, and love of learning to the technical world. I will cherish
our lunches spent together flying our AR Drones, sometimes crashing
them into walls and each other, while trying to find creative ways of
controlling them with code.  He was just lately exploring with the
micro-quadcopters like the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Estes-4606-Proto-Quadcopter-Black/dp/B00G924W98">Proto-X</a>.
We had plans to make all our Spheros, Roombas, big drones, and little
drones dance to live coded music. We were both auditing on
<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/ethx/ethx-amrx-autonomous-mobile-robots-1342">Autonomous Mobile Robots</a>
to see what we could learn to help us with our robot dreams.</p>

<p>I miss him dearly.  I will cherish my memories of him and I am so
grateful for all the ways he has enriched my life.  I will remember
that when I dream in code, he is still there with me.</p>

<p>Until that day when we will fly our friendly robots together again.</p>

		<p>Amy and Frank fled down the stairs from her office and met an
unexpected obstacle to their exit, a locked door.  As
they peered out the window, they saw yesterday&rsquo;s Amy pull up in the
parking space, get out, retrieve her laptop, and start to head in
the front door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh good, we can take your car&rdquo;, said Frank.</p>

<p>Amy took a second to recover from the shock of seeing what her hair really
looked like from behind and then asked, &ldquo;But, how can we get to it?
The door is locked, and we
can&rsquo;t go back up to the office&hellip; I would meet myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank smiled, pulled out the <em>Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to Clojure</em> and
pulled up a page with the heading <em>Locked Doors and Other Small
Bothers</em>.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3346/3191331375_a773bff1b7_n.jpg"></p>

<p><em>One of the reasons for the surprising success of <strong>The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide
to Clojure</strong> is helpful advice of on an assortment of practical
matters.</em></p>

<p><em>Locked doors are a common nuisance in modern times.  Fortunately,
Clojure provides a very handy function for such occasions, <a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/1.2.0/clojure.core/fnil">fnil</a>.
This commonly overlooked function, takes an existing function and
returns a new function that allows you to specify a default
for a nil parameter. For example, take this locked door:</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">locked-door</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">key</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">if </span><span class="nb">key </span><span class="s">&quot;open&quot;</span> <span class="s">&quot;nope - staying shut&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">locked-door</span> <span class="ss">:key</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;=&gt; &quot;open&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">locked-door</span> <span class="nv">nil</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;=&gt; &quot;nope - staying shut&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>In this case, the simple application of fnil will help remove this
pesky obstacle.</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">this-door</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">fnil</span> <span class="nv">locked-door</span> <span class="ss">:another-key-that-works</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">this-door</span> <span class="ss">:key</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;=&gt; &quot;open&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">this-door</span> <span class="nv">nil</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;=&gt; open</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Please be advised, that some doors are locked for a good reason. It
is left to the user&rsquo;s discretion. But it is highly recommended in Norway&rsquo;s
moose regions, to think twice.</em></p>

<p>They unlocked the door and headed for Amy&rsquo;s car.  She couldn&rsquo;t decide
whether she was surprised or not to find her keys in her pocket, so
she gave up and just got in instead.  After a short drive, they
arrived at the zoo and navigated their way through various
school groups and arrive at the Aquarium.</p>

<p>Amy at this point, having prided herself on her adaptable nature, was
still having trouble processing the latest events. She had
discovered that Frank was a Datomic time traveller,  the  world was
made of Clojure, and it was also about to be destroyed in a short
future that she just came from.  Her rational brain, (which was
currently working way too hard), was quite
relieved to be distracted by the sight of two really adorable otters.  They were floating
contentedly around the pool, occasionally stopping to crack an Abalone
shell on their fuzzy tummies.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sea-otters.jpg"></p>

<p>Her rational brain, after having a nice breather, finally re-asserted
itself and made Amy ask Frank:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are we here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Otters are the front-line Chrono-guards, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went on to explain that otters are tasked with the important job of
keeping a close watch on human civilization and making critical, minor
adjustments to keep things on an even track.  All those nature videos
of otters cracking shells with rocks?  They are really evaluating
Clojure expressions crucial to our way of life. Most of the time, they
prefer to do their work remote.  They find floating on their backs in
the peaceful waters the most productive work environment.  However,
sometimes they will construct zoos or aquariums, when their work
requires them to keep a closer watch on some areas.  In times of great
need, they might even take a human form for a short while.  Recently,
one of their agents was inadvertently
<a href="https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6003866624/h0B1E03BF/">exposed</a> and
required a few extra Abalone shells to straighten out.</p>

<p>Frank opened his pack and handed his evaluator to Amy to hold
while fished out four mini-marshmallows.  He gave two to Amy and then
proceeded to put one in his ear and the other in his mouth.  More
remarkably still, he appeared to be speaking with the otters.</p>

<p><em>Mini-marshmallows are the best way to create portable Clojure
<a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async">core.async</a> channels that
won&rsquo;t melt in your hands.</em></p>

<p><em>To construct a channel simply use <em>chan</em></em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">talk-to-otters-chan</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">chan</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Channels by default are unbuffered, which keeps them at the
mini-marshmallow size.  It requires a rendezvous of a channel producer
and consumer to communicate.  In the case of otters, someone to talk to
the otters and the otters, themselves, to listen. Be advised that with
a regular blocking put <strong>>!!</strong>, the main thread will be blocked.
That is, if you try to speak to the otter, you will be stuck there

<p>Amy put one of the mini-marshmallows in her ear.  She immediately
began to hear the conversation that Frank was having with the otters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who would want to destroy the entire world?  That is really kinda
over-board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know, but there was someone on Galactic Hacker News
the other day that was quite tiffed over the idea that Clojure was considered
a Lisp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amy reached to put the other marshmallow in her mouth to ask a very
important question.  But unfortunately, as she moved her hand, she
accidentally pushed the big red <em>Source</em> button on the evaluator.
Suddenly, she and Frank were swept up in a vortex that spun them
around and sucked them down into the ground.</p>

		<p>Amy and Frank were hurtled quite rapidly through time and space after
attaching themselves to a transaction headed through the
<a href="http://docs.datomic.com/transactions.html">Datomic Transactor</a>. From
there things slowed down a bit, then took a sharp left and
ricocheted off again with incredible speed until they landed in another
<a href="http://docs.datomic.com/architecture.html">Datomic Peer</a>, and finally
appeared in the same room.  Amy was quite startled by the
anti-climatic nature of the whole dematerializing and rematerializing
in the same exact spot, and didn&rsquo;t really know what to do next.  She
surveyed her office and found it exactly the same,
except for two distinct details.  For one, the pistachio shells had
disappeared, and for another, the date on the computer showed
yesterday at 8:00 am.  She tried to connect these facts rationally
with the pistachios in her pocket and finally said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am about to come into work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank, who was busily hunting through his blue zippered pack around
his waist, looked up briefly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we better get out of here then, I only have a blue fanny pack.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to Clojure explains that the &ldquo;fanny pack&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;bum bag&rdquo;, is the symbol of a licensed Chrono-agent.  The rank of the
Chrono-agent can be clearly determined by its color on the ROYGBIV
scale.</em></p>

<p><em>The origins of this licensing method can be traced to an embarrassing
incident in human history known as &ldquo;The Great Flood&rdquo;. A junior
Chrono-agent was trying to increase the yield of a tomato crop during
a dry spell and was trying to do the following recursive function in his evaluator:</em></p>

mini-marshmallows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got it. Come on, let&rsquo;s go! Someone is trying to destroy the world and
we need to see the otters.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The following is a cautionary example of the unpredictable
combination of Clojure, a marathon viewing of the BBC&rsquo;s series &ldquo;The
Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy&rdquo;, and a questionable amount of
cheese.</em></p>

<p>There have been many tourism guides to the
<a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> programming language.  Some that easily
come to mind for their intellectual erudition and prose are &ldquo;The Joy
of Touring Clojure&rdquo;, &ldquo;Touring Clojure&rdquo;, &ldquo;Clojure Touring&rdquo;, and the
newest edition of &ldquo;Touring Clojure Touring&rdquo;.  However, none has
surpassed the wild popularity of &ldquo;The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to Clojure&rdquo;.
It has sold over 500 million copies and has been on the &ldquo;BigInt&rsquo;s
Board of Programming Language Tourism&rdquo; for the past 15 years. While,
arguably, it
lacked the in-depth coverage of the other guides, it made up for it in
useful practical tips, such as what to do if you find a nil in your
pistachio.  Most of all, the cover had the following words printed in
very large letters: <strong>Don&rsquo;t Worry About the Parens</strong>.</p>

<p>To tell the story of the book, it is best to tell the story of two
people whose lives were affected by it: Amy Denn, one of the last
remaining <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language">Pascal</a> developers in Cincinnati, and Frank Pecan, a time
traveler, guidebook reseacher, and friend of Amy.</p>

<p>Amy, at this moment, was completely unaware of the chronological
advantages of her friend, being preoccupied with the stark fact that
she was about to be fired.  She had been given a direct order from her
CEO to deploy the code at 3:05pm.  It was now 3:00pm and she had
realized that if she did so, all the data painstaking collected about
the effects of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuvan_throat_singing">Throat Singing</a> on
the growth rate of tomatoes would be erased. Unfortunately, the CEO
did not really understand or trust anything having to do with
technology or programming.  In truth, the only two things that he
seemed to care about were tomatoes and checklists of unreasonable
things. The fact that no course of action available to her in the next
5 minutes would help her employment situation, agitated Amy so much
that she was violently shelling and eating pistachio nuts.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3331/3659226924_fbf336379e_n.jpg"></p>

<p>The &ldquo;Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to Clojure&rdquo; says that
<em>pistachios are Nature&rsquo;s
most perfect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">s-expression</a>. An
s-expression is recursively composed of s-expressions or an atom.
In the case of the humble pistachio, the atom is the nut inside. The
atom simply evaluates to itself.  This is best seen is an example
where the following expressions are evaluated in the Clojure
<a href="http://tryclj.com/">REPL</a></em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="s">&quot;hi&quot;</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; &quot;hi&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; 1</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">true</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; true</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">nil</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; nil</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>`</p>

<p><em>Which leads to the very practical tip of what to do if you find a nil
in your pistachio.  The answer, of course, is to be thankful that you
have a value that represents the absence of a value &ndash; and to get
another pistachio.</em></p>

<p><em>In Clojure, a s-expression is written with parens.  The first element
within the parens is an operator or function and the rest of the
elements are treated as data, some of which can be s-expression
themselves.</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; 3</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; 5</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Considering the pistachio again, we can think of the nut in the shell
as an s-expression, (providing we also imagine an operator or function
right in front of the nut).</em></p>

<p><em>Here we define a function that will turn the nut red, by appending the
string &ldquo;red&rdquo; to the nut-name.</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">red</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">nut</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">str </span><span class="s">&quot;red &quot;</span> <span class="nv">nut</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">red</span> <span class="s">&quot;nut1&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; &quot;red nut1&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Notice that if we put a quote in front of the expression, it will no
longer be evaluated.</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">red</span> <span class="s">&quot;nut1&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; (red &quot;nut1&quot;)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>quoting the expression turns it into a list, which we can then
manipulate with other s-expressions (code as data).</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">first </span><span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">red</span> <span class="s">&quot;nut1&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; red</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">last </span><span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">red</span> <span class="s">&quot;nut1&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; &quot;nut1&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>If we try to evaluate the s-expression with just the nut name in the
parens, we get an error because there is no function in
the first slot.</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;nut1&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;=&gt; ClassCastException java.lang.String cannot be cast to clojure.lang.IFn</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>The whole thing of having to have a function in front of the nut in
the pistachio has invited much heated debate on the suitability of
pistachios being held up as the paragon of an s-expression.  But
critics have failed to explain the corroborating evidence of red
pistachio nuts, or find a more suitable nut.</em></p>

<p>Amy&rsquo;s time traveling friend, Frank, is due to appear on the scene
momentarily to reveal that the whole world is really made of Clojure
<a href="http://www.datomic.com/">Datomic</a> datoms.  Furthermore, a transaction
is going to be evaluated soon, which will retract all the facts on
EVERYTHING. The practical effect of this will be that nothing will
have an attributes. A world without any attributes at all would be
quite boring and, for all purposes, be non-existent. Luckily for Amy, Frank is a Datomic Time
Traveller and has a hand-held &ldquo;evaluator&rdquo; which will save them. Also
luckily, the readers will be spared dialog, since the author
can never figure out where to put the punctuation and is really
rubbish at it.  Only one phrase will be illustrated.  This is the
rather important one, having been uttered by Amy after it was explained to her
that she, and the entire world around her, was entirely composed of
Clojure:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the language with a lot of parens?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To which, Frank handed her the &ldquo;Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to Clojure&rdquo; and
pointed to the words on the front cover,  <strong>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Worry About the
Parens.&rdquo;</strong>, and turned to the first page.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;There is absolutely no need to worry about the parens. It is known
 today that the first really important discovery of humankind was not
 fire, but <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit">Paredit</a>.  Paredit
 mode magically acts to insert and balance the right parens to the
 point where they actually can no longer be seen.  This is evident by
 just looking around you. The world is made of Clojure and there are
 millions, billions, and trillions of parens all around you and your
 tea cup right now.  Yet, you don&rsquo;t see them.  Paredit mode.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>At the urging of Frank, Amy quickly stuffed the remaining pistachios
in her pockets while he readied his evaluator. The display showed
some large integer value, that decreased as he pushed the buttons on
the console.  Finally, he pushed the large red button and two parens
started glowing on either side of them &hellip; and they disappeared.</p>

<p>After attending a local Lean Startup Circle meetup, I decided to write
about some of my experiences with the
<a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup Methodology</a> from a software
developer&rsquo;s point of view.</p>

<h2>Why should you care about the Lean Startup Methodology?</h2>

<p>As software developer, I put my passion, honed expertise, and time
into crafting a digital product or service. One of the worst things
that can happen is that when it is released, no one uses it or wants
it. You can build a absolutely beautiful software product that scales
to the nines. But if you build the wrong thing, it is a failure.</p>

<p>The Lean Startup Methodology is basically a scientific approach to
developing business and products. You analyze your assumptions and
then devise experiments to test your hypotheses. One of the ways that
you can test them, is by talking to people and doing customer
interviews.</p>

<h2>Talking to Random People is Terrifying</h2>

<p>The prospect of talking to random people on the street is a terrifying
prospect for me as a semi-introverted software developer. It is also
incredibly useful to get out of the office and actually get feedback.
These tips come from a Lean Startup Weekend in Columbus at the Neo
office, where I successfully got
out of my comfort zone and engaged in customer interviews.</p>

<p>Background:  Our team was designing experiments around creating an app
for Food Trucks.  The fundamental assumption that we wanted to
validate was &ndash; &ldquo;People will pay money for a phone app that will tell
them where all the Food Trucks are.&rdquo;  So we headed downtown to the
local food market. This was a place where there were local artisan
food vendors in a food hall.  It seemed like an ideal place to find
people interested in good food and Food Trucks.</p>

<h3>Tip #1 &ndash; You will suck at first, but it gets better</h3>

<p>The first few people I tried to talk were complete failures. I felt
like a complete idiot. Do not get discouraged.  It helps if you go
with someone else for moral support, although you should interview
people by yourself, so they don&rsquo;t feel intimidated.</p>

<h3>Tip #2 &ndash; Have your questions written down</h3>

<p>Come prepared with the questions that you want to ask people, so you
don&rsquo;t have a brain freeze with nervousness.  However, I found I got
people to talk to me more if I didn&rsquo;t carry the pad of paper with me.
Basically anything you can do to look less like a marketer helps.</p>

<h3>Tip #3 &ndash; Tell them what you are trying to build first</h3>

<p>DO NOT START OUT LIKE THIS:  &ldquo;Can I ask you a few questions?&rdquo;
This never worked. Again, this is what a marketer would say.
I got my best responses by telling people that I was a software
developer looking to build a app for Food Trucks. In most cases, they
were happy to give advice on whether they would use the app and how
much they would pay for it.</p>

<h3>Tip #4 &ndash; Write down your results right away</h3>

<p>Memory is a fleeting thing.  Try to record the results of your
conversation right away.  Take the notepad from your pocket and go to
a corner or table and note everything down, before you forgot it all.
Also try to write down what the person said, not just your
interpretation. If someone is helping you interview, you can have one
person be a scribe, while one person talks.</p>

<h3>Tip #5 &ndash; Give Gifts</h3>

<p>If you have any funding available for this endeavor, you can get a
stack of Amazon $10 gift cards for people&rsquo;s time. This was some advice
given to us. I didn&rsquo;t actually try it for this particular outing, but
I have heard that others have used it very successfully.</p>

<h2>Getting out of your Comfort Zone is Scary but Rewarding</h2>

<p>I certainly got out of my comfort zone as a developer that weekend.
But the end result was worth it.  We ended up disproving our
hypothesis the people would pay for our app.  Almost all the people we
interviewed said that they would download the app, but no one was
willing to pay for it.  We invalidated a core assumption, it was a
success.</p>

<p>We could move on to testing and validating another idea that could be a viable business product.</p>

<p>Build things that matter.  Build well. Build the right things.</p>

<p>I felt like I was in a controlling relationship headed downhill.
After two custom laptops returned for defective hardware, I wanted to
leave.  But leaving didn&rsquo;t seem so easy after living in the walled
garden of Apple all those years.</p>

<p>This blog post is about how to leave your Mac and return to OSS.</p>

<h2>Make a New Plan, Stan</h2>

<p>There are quite a few nice alternatives to the Mac Air out there.
I decided to go with the new
<a href="http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/xps-13-linux/pd">Sputnik 3</a>.
Some of my reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Powerful &ndash; New Haswell processor</li>
<li>13.3 inch touch display with 1920 x 1080 resolution</li>
<li>Ships with Ubuntu 12.04 (64 bit)</li>
<li>Nice design (yes looks are important)</li>
</ul>


<p>It arrived a couple of days before Christmas. The packaging itself
was quite nice.  Here is a picture next
to my 13 inch Mac Air.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7334/11572078553_7efe0e609e.jpg"></p>

<p>The best was that everything just &ldquo;worked&rdquo; out of the box.
I had no problems configuring Ubuntu and getting the wireless network
hooked up.  I could close the lid and reopen it and have &ldquo;instant on&rdquo;
just like the Mac Air.  The keyboard is enjoyable to use and nicely
backlit.  The sleek design and light weight of the laptop is very
comparable to the Mac Air.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3753/11571869965_06975d698c.jpg"></p>

<h2>Hop on the Bus, Gus</h2>

<p>It took my about a day to set up all my programs that I use on a daily
basis.
Here is a overview:</p>

<h4>Application Dock/ Organization &ndash; Dash</h4>

<p>Ubuntu has a dock on the left hand side of the screen, that is very
similar to the mac one.  You can right click and pin applications to
the dock to keep them in there. Clicking into the dash option, you can
browse your applications that are installed.</p>

<h4>Getting New Apps &ndash; Ubuntu Software Center or apt-get</h4>

<p>You can install new applications easily by using the Ubuntu Software
Center.  Browsing the applications and installing them is point and
click easy. If you don&rsquo;t see the one you need or need a more recent
version, you can always install via the command line with</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install package-name
</code></pre>

<h4>Browser &ndash; Firefox or Chromium</h4>

<p>Ubuntu comes with Firefox and Chromium installed.
You can also go with Chrome of course.</p>

<h4>Mail &ndash; Thunderbird</h4>

<p>Ubuntu comes with Thunderbird mail ready to go.
I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to setup Thunderbird
Mail.  You simply put in your email and password.  Ubuntu keeps a
configuration list of commonly used email providers.  It automagically
figured out the correct domains and ports to use. On the downside, it
doesn&rsquo;t do anything magic with your contacts. So you are on your own
there.  I also just found out about
<a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/10/geary-0-4-released-with-new-look-new-features">Geary</a>,
which looks pretty sweet.</p>

<h4>Password Management &ndash; 1 Password Anywhere + Dropbox / LastPass</h4>

<p>There is not a linux client for 1Password. I can still use it by using
<a href="http://help.agilebits.com/1Password3/1passwordanywhere.html">1PasswordAnywhere</a>.
I just have a bookmark to the 1PasswordAnyway link and I haz my
logins. I am switching over to LastPass though, so you can edit / add
new passwords. There is also an import utility to move stuff over from 1Password.</p>

<h4>Emacs</h4>

<p>Emacs just works :)
It might be just me, but I think it is happier back on Ubuntu.
I did an apt-get to get the 24 version.</p>

<h4>Git Client</h4>

<p>I went with gitg for a graphical Git client. It seems to have all the
things you need.</p>

<h4>Terminal &ndash; Byobu</h4>

<p><a href="http://byobu.co/">Byobu Terminal</a> comes already installed in Ubuntu. I have been taking
it for a test drive and really like some of the features of easily
adding new tabs, splitting screens and re-attaching to sessions.</p>

<h4>Evernote/ Everpad</h4>

<p>With
<a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/09/use-evernote-in-ubuntu-with-everpad">Everpad</a>,
I can still use all my evernote stuff too.</p>

<h4>Presentations &ndash; LibreOffice / Reveal.js</h4>

<p>I have used Keynote heavily on the Mac.  For existing presentations, I
can convert them to ppt format and then modify or run in LibreOffice
Impress. Most likely with all my new presentations, I will just use a
JavaScript framework like <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">reveal.js</a></p>

<h4>Communication &ndash; Hipchat / Skype/ Google Hangouts / Campfire</h4>

<p>We use Hipchat for messaging at work.  Hipchat has a linux client
that works just the same.  Skype also has a linux client.  Of course,
Google Hangouts is just fine on the web.  I also use Campfire
sometimes. There are a couple of linux clients out there, but I
haven&rsquo;t tried them yet.  The web version works fine for me right now.</p>

<h4>iPhone</h4>

<p>On my mac, I used to plug in my phone and sync to my dropbox.  I tried
plugging in my phone, but unfortunately, iOS7 put in a security
feature to that prevents having the phone connect properly.  The
solution for me is to just use the phone dropbox app to sync the
pictures automatically to my Dropbox.</p>

<h2>Get Yourself Free</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t expect the road to free of bumps.  I have only been using my
new laptop for a week.  But so far, it has been an enjoyable switch.
The hardware is really impressive, and it feels good getting back to
OSS.</p>

<p>Best of all, I set myself free.</p>

		<p>After having spent some time recently looking at top-down AI, I
thought I would spend some time looking at bottom&rsquo;s up AI, machine
learning and neural networks.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly introduced to <a href="https://twitter.com/mikera">@mikea&rsquo;s</a> <a href="https://github.com/mikera/core.matrix">core.matrix</a> at Clojure Conj
this year and wanted to try making my own neural network using the
library. The purpose of this blog is to share my learnings along the
way.</p>

<h2>What is a neural network?</h2>

<p>A neural network is an approach to machine learning that involves
simulating, (in an idealized way), the way our brains work on a
biological level.  There are three layers to neural network: the input
layer, the hidden layers, and the output layer.  Each layer consists
of neurons that have a value.  In each layer, each neuron is connected to
the neuron in the next layer by a connection strength. To get data
into the neural network, you assign values to the input layer, (values
between 0 and 1). These values are then &ldquo;fed forward&rdquo; to the hidden layer neurons though an algorithm that
relies on the input values and the connection strengths. The values
are finally &ldquo;fed forward&rdquo; in a similar fashion to the output layer.
The &ldquo;learning&rdquo; portion of the neural network comes from &ldquo;training&rdquo; the
network data.  The training data consists of a collection of
associated input values and target values. The training process at a
high level looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Feed forward input values to get the output values</li>
<li>How far off are the output values from the target values?</li>
<li>Calculate the error values and adjust the strengths of the network</li>
<li>Repeat until you think it has &ldquo;learned&rdquo; enough, that is when you
feed the input values in the result of the output values are close
enough to the target you are looking for</li>
</ul>


<p>The beauty of this system is that the neural network, (given the right
configuration and the right training), can approximate any function &ndash;
just by exposing it to data.</p>

<h2>Start Small</h2>

<p>I wanted to start with a very small network so that I could understand
the algorithms and actually do the maths for the tests along the way.
The network configuration I chose is one with 1 hidden layer.  The
input layer has 2 neurons, the hidden layer has 3 neurons and the
output layer has 2 neurons.</p>

<h2>Feed Forward</h2>

<p>Alright, we have values in the input neuron layer, let&rsquo;s feed them
forward through the network. The new value of neuron in the hidden
layer is the sum of all the inputs of its connections multiplied by
the connection strength.  The neuron can also have its own threshold,
(meaning you would subtract the threshold from the sum of inputs), but
to keep things a simple as possible in this example, the threshold is
0 &ndash; so we will ignore it.  The sum is then feed into an activation
function, that has an output in the range of -1 to 1.  The activation
function is the tanh function.  We will also need the derivative of
the tanh function a little later when we are calculating errors, so we
will define both here.</p>

<p>Alright!  We have our answer
[0.02315019005321053 0.027608061500083565].
Notice that the values are pretty much the same.  This is because we
haven&rsquo;t trained our network to do anything yet.</p>

<h2>Backwards Propagation</h2>

<p>To train our network, we have to let it know what the answer,(or
target), should be, so we can calculate the errors and finally update
our connection strengths. For this simple example, let&rsquo;s just inverse
the data &ndash; so given an input of [1 0] should give us an output of
[0 1].</p>

<h3>Calculate the errors of the hidden layer</h3>

<p>The errors of the hidden layer are based off the deltas that we just
found from the output layer.  In fact, for each hidden neuron, the
error delta is the gradient of the activation function multiplied by
the weighted sum of the ouput deltas of connected ouput neurons and
it&rsquo;s connection strength.  This should remind you of the forward
propagation of the inputs &ndash; but this time we are doing it backwards
with the error deltas.</p>

<h3>Updating the connection strengths</h3>

<p>Great!  We have all the error deltas, now we are ready to go ahead and
update the connection strengths.  In general this is the same process
for both the hidden-output connections and the input-hidden
connections.</p>

<ul>
<li>weight-change = error-delta * neuron-value</li>
<li>new-weight = weight + learning rate * weight-change</li>
</ul>


<p>The learning rate controls how fast the weigths and errors should be
adjusted.  It the learning rate is too high, then there is the danger
that it will converge to fit the solution too fast and not find the
best solution.  If the learning rate is too low, it may never actually
converge to the right solution given the training data that it is
using. For this example, let&rsquo;s use a training rate of 0.2</p>

<h2>Putting the pieces together</h2>

<p>We have done it!  In our simple example we have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Forward propagated the input to get the output</li>
<li>Calculated the errors from the target through backpropogation</li>
<li>Updated the connection strengths/ weights</li>
</ul>


<p>We just need to put all the pieces together. We&rsquo;ll do this with the
values that we got earlier to make sure it is all working.</p>

<h3>Construct a network representation</h3>

<p>It would be nice if we could represent an entire neural network in a
data structure.  That way the whole transformation of feeding forward
and training the network could give us a new network back.
So lets define the data structure as
[input-neurons input-hidden-strengths hidden-neurons hidden-output-strengths output-neurons].</p>

<p>We will start off with all the values of the neurons being zero.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Generalized feed forward</h3>

<p>Now we can make a feed forward function that takes this network and
constructs a new network based on input values and the
layer-activation function that we defined earlier.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This should match up with the values that we got earlier when we were
just working on the individual pieces.</p>

<p>Whoa!  The trained example isn&rsquo;t perfect, but we can see that it is
getting closer to the right answer.  It is learning!</p>

<h2>MOR Training Data</h2>

<p>Well this is really cool and it is working.  But it would be nicer to
be able to present a set of training data for it to learn on.  For
example, it would be nice to have a training data structure look like:</p>

<p>Wow. The more examples it sees, the better that network is doing at
learning what to do!</p>

<h3>General Construct Network</h3>

<p>The only piece that we are missing now is to have a function that will
create a general neural network for us.  We can choose how many input
nerurons, hidden neurons, and output neurons and have a network
constructed with random weights.</p>

<p>Now we can construct our network from scratch and train it.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it.  We have constucted a neural network with core.matrix</p>

<h2>Want more?</h2>

<p>I put together a github library based on the neural network code in
the posts.  It is called <a href="https://github.com/gigasquid/k9">K9</a>, named
after Dr. Who&rsquo;s best dog friend.  You can find the examples we have
gone through in the tests.  There is also an example program using it
in the examples directory.  It learns what colors are based on thier
RGB value.</p>

<p>There are a couple web resources I would recommend if you want to look
farther as well.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ1qgCr09j8&amp;feature=player_embedded">Mike Anderson&rsquo;s Clojure Conj talk on Neural Networks</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Go forth and create Neural Networks!</p>

<p>One of the wonderful things about being a technologist today, is
to be part of an industry that is bubbling over with new and
exciting things. It can be exhilarating and overwhelming. How can we
try and do all these great new things?  Of course, it is not
sensible to simply drop whatever you are using and continually chase
after the newest tech.  Nor is steadfastly staying in one place and
refusing to accept that there is a better way of doing things.  The
challenge is to absorb, identify, and synthesize both good of the
what we are currently doing and the new stuff too.  We want to embrace and continue the good things that
are working for us and reach for the new technologies that will propel
us farther in the future.</p>

<p>Since everyone has their own experience synthesizing the world around
them, there are many differing opinions on what we should continue to
embrace and what we technologies and practices should reach for.  I
humbly offer my thoughts on this based from my own perspective.</p>

<h2>Embrace: Agile Feedback</h2>

<h2>Reach for: Lean Startup Discipline and Programmer Anarchy</h2>

<p>Agile has become a victim of its own success.  Becoming so big, its
message has been confused and abused in too many ways to name.  But
the core pillar of frequent and continuous feedback is a foundation to
any successful software project and should be embraced.  However, we
should not stop there.  We should reach for the rewards that <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles">Lean Startup
Methodology</a> offers in the form
of displinced validation.  We should also
reach to unleash the innovation of our smart developers with
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk-CF7klLdA">Programmer Anarchy</a>, and
look for ways to ruthlessly stomp out unnecessary and wasteful
project management practices.</p>

<h2>Embrace: Ruby&rsquo;s Community</h2>

<h2>Reach for: Clojure, Go, Elixir, and Meteor</h2>

<p>Ruby and Rails have been an incredible game changer for web
development.  But they too are suffering from their own success.  One
of the strengths of Ruby, which should be embraced and nutured, is the
strength of the community and the openness to newcomers.  This strength
yields a fruitful ground for a vibrant library ecosystem, which has
helped Ruby flourish.  We need to reach beyond Ruby and Rails to other
languages and frameworks that focus on simplicity and concurrency.  The bright future
will belong to the likes of <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>,
<a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>, <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>, and <a href="http://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a>.  We need
to reach and start using these in the products we build, while
encouraging the growth of a welcoming community and ecosystem like the
one we have in Ruby.</p>

<h2>Embrace: Collaboration</h2>

<h2>Reach for: the Distributed and Decentralized</h2>

<p>Collaboration with tools like Google Docs works.  We should continue
to embrace the power that this gives us. However we should embrace
tools for combining this collaboration in a truly distributed and
decentralized manner. Git itself is wonderful and distributed, but we
should reach for tools like Github to be more decentralized and resilient.
As privacy concerns grow in today&rsquo;s world.  We need to reach beyond
the convenience that a centralized source of information gives us and
truly understand the trade offs involved.</p>

<p>We live in an incredible, vibrant time.  Look around and what you
do everyday.  Embrace and nurture all the good parts, and never give up
reaching for something better.</p>
