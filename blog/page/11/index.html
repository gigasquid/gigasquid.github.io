  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I have always wanted to contribute to Open Source.  I have reaped the benefits of using Open Source packages throughout the years, I sincerely want to give back.  What has been stopping me all this time?      Lack of time is my main excuse.  I have two small children and by the time I clean up from dinner and get them bathed and off to bed, there is little time left to code.   I tend to use this excuse for lots of other tasks that I avoid around the house, like closet cleaning, reorganizing the garage, etc …  But an excuse is exactly what it is.</p>

<p>I learned an invaluable technique to tackling projects around the house that I would like to get done, but seem too large or for some other reason have become subject to procrastination.  First, I schedule a day to do something about it and then I put on a timer and just start doing it for 15 minutes.  After 15 minutes, I am officially done.  I can quit with no guilt and have the lovely feeling of having made a dent.  Most often, once I get started, I want to keep with it and really get rolling.  That&rsquo;s OK too.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday, I decided to apply this technique and made a date with Open Source.  After a Ruby user group, the night before,  demonstrated the mechanics of fixing a bug using GitHub, I was finally confident enough to give it a go myself.  I created a GitHub account, forked the Redmine project, fixed a bite-sized bug and submitted a patch – all in one night!</p>

<p>I was so jazzed up about it, that I decided that I was going to continue in my Open Source contribution quest on a limited time budget, by declaring that my Wednesday night is my Open Source night.  It might only be 15 or 30 min, but I will be doing something and feeling that contribution buzz goodness.</p>

<p>I encourage everyone that has been struggling to find time for Open Source to just schedule one night a week.  Just do something for 15 min and see what flows …</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I decided to start playing with RDFs to start me on the road to understanding and programming Semantic Web.  As always, the first step it to start with a “Hello World” type of exercise.  In my case, I had armed myself with a good cappuccino at Starbucks and decided to set myself with a purl link and FOAF page.
<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/FOAF_%28software%29">
FOAF (Friend of a Friend)</a> is one of the most popular vocabularies out there for RDF (Resource Description Framework).  It expresses relationships in a machine readable format and is considered one of the first social Semantic Web applications.</p>

<p>When you look at a foaf.rdf file, it is basically just an file with xml tags:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;foaf:Person rdf:ID="me"&gt;
&lt;foaf:name&gt;Carin Meier&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
&lt;foaf:givenname&gt;Carin&lt;/foaf:givenname&gt;
&lt;foaf:family_name&gt;Meier&lt;/foaf:family_name&gt;
&lt;foaf:nick&gt;squid&lt;/foaf:nick&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Not too much fun to start coding by hand though.  Luckily, there is a handy dandy generator &ndash; <a href="http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic">FOAF-a-matic.</a> Just fill in the form and you can easily generate the basic foaf rdf file for yourself.  You can always add to it later.  Save the file as foaf.rdf somewhere on your website for indexing.</p>

<p>Now you can do some fun stuff with it.  You can check and visualize your RDF document with <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/">http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/</a>.  Or you can use a<a href="http://foaf-visualizer.org/?uri=http://gigasquidsoftware.com/foaf/foaf.rdf"> FOAF visualizer</a>.</p>

<p>The final part is to set yourself up with a purl address.  <a href="http://www.purl.org/docs/index.html">Purl.org</a> is a website that is dedicated to providing web endpoints or addresses that can be indentifiers for individuals.  It provides a layer of indirection that is very useful in the changing world of the web.  For example, if I use my work web page link as my identifier in my RDF and then I change jobs, all my FOAF links will be broken.  However, I can use my purl address and set up my identifier as my webpage and then change it when then need arises.   So logon to purl.org and set yourself up with an account.
When other people &ldquo;know&rdquo; you in FOAF, they can use your purl link:</p>

<blockquote><p>&lt;foaf:Person>
&lt;foaf:name>Carin Meier&lt;/foaf:name>
&lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource=&ldquo;<a href="http://purl.org/net/cmeier">http://purl.org/net/cmeier</a>&rdquo;/>
&lt;/foaf:Person></p></blockquote>

<p>My FOAF is <a href="http://gigasquidsoftware.com/foaf/foaf.rdf">http://gigasquidsoftware.com/foaf/foaf.rdf</a>
My purl link is <a href="http://purl.org/net/cmeier">http://purl.org/net/cmeier</a></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it!  Hello World in FOAF!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I attended my first NFJS conference last weekend up in Columbus.  Overall, it was an excellent experience.   The speakers were all first rate and I got a chance to hang out and meet some other like-minded people who are interested in giving up a weekend to learn new technologies and generally just geek-out.</p>

<p>The main technologies that stood out to me are concurrency and semantic web.   Concurrency and functional programming are becoming more and more important with the ability to scale out on the server, rather then scale up (horizontal vs vertical scaling).    There is always some threshold to the amount of power that you can throw at one system.  However, that limit disappears if you can spread the load out across many servers.  Java runs into some real problems with threads and concurrency.  For this reason, the functional languages like Scala, Erlang, and Clojure are really starting to shine.   I was so impressed with Clojure, that I picked up a book for my “play around and take a look at” tech stack.</p>

<p>The highlight of the conference for me was on Sunday.  I was fortunate enough to attend all of Brian Sletten&rsquo;s sessions on REST, RDF,  and all things Semantic Web.   I was interested in the Semantic Web before I attended, but afterwards it is my new love.   I have always been interested in databases and datasets, so discovering a technology that enriches data in a open distributed way across the web just made me giddy.   The potential enterprise applications are very exciting.  When RDF is combined with a HATEOS architecture, you have can have a robust, scalable, agile architecture that can integrate data across many different systems and datasources.   These rich datasources can be sliced and diced for reporting and BI and can also be secured by row/ column level like security.    On the e-commerce side of the Internet, even very simple implementations of  RDF vocabularies are yielding very promising results.  Best Buy put in a semantic web vocabulary on their website that resulted in 30% increase of sales.   It is a very exciting time for semantic web technologies.  I am a firm believer in that it is “ all about the data”.   I think for the future it will be more like “Why have just data when you can have data with context?”</p>

<p>All in all, I had a great time and it was definitely worth the trip up to Columbus for the weekend.  If you have chance to check out NFJS or any stuff about the Semantic Web or Functional Languages, go for it.  You will enjoy it.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3833/9925947563_50031edb46_o.jpg"></p>

<p>I have been attending talks on functional programming languages at NFJS over the past couple of days.  I have to admit it, I am really taken with the power of Scala and Clojure to tackle problems that Java cannot handle.  I even purchased a Clojure book to add to my &ldquo;languages to take a good hard look at&rdquo; stack.   I really believe that it is true that the functional languages have a lot to offer.</p>

<p> However, let&rsquo;s not loose track of one really powerful tool that the Object Oriented world provides to us.   This is the way to model the world in a more natural way.  Since we do this all the time in Java and other object oriented languages, we take it for granted now.   But the advantage that this modeling the world in our mind and our code is tremendous.  One of the biggest constraint on developing software is the ability to hold in our minds the mental model of what the code is doing and how it is doing it.  Once, you do this – you “know the application”.   Having the ability to break the world up into chunks that more easily fit allows us to more naturally build applications without the complexity drowning us out.</p>

<p>I am wary of the temptation to “throw the baby out with the bathwater” to go to pure functional and leave objects behind.  This is way Scala seems like a pragmatic solution, since it allows you to turn the dial back and forth from the Object Oriented way of doing things to the functional side.</p>

<p>That being said, I still intend to learn Clojure next instead of Scala.  Why?  Because to learn a new language that is a new way of thinking, I would prefer not to have an alternative way to fall back to old familiar ways of thinking.  That way you can really get a new perspective on things to see what the true functional side has to offer.  And no, I am not hard core enough to learn Haskell.</p>

<p>One thing is for sure.  The future is multi-core.</p>

      <h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/2010/06/09/customer-zone-developer-zone-most-excellent-zone/" itemprop="url">Customer Zone + Developer Zone = Most Excellent Zone</a></h2>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I think most developers are familiar with getting in the “zone”.  The place you get when you are totally in focus and in the flow of development.  The code comes quickly, the ideas are together and everything just seems to work.  It is the sweet spot of productivity.  I have found the best way for me to get into the zone is to put on my headphones, arrange some uninterrupted time and just start going.</p>

<p>There is another zone, however, that I think is just as important.  This is getting into the zone with the customer.  At the beginning of a project, or even just joining a new company, you have to get to know your customer.  It involves a lot of learning the business rules, processes, and just plain communication style.  In these early stages, there is a bound to be some misunderstandings.  This is where the iterative development process really shines.   With each feedback cycle, you get closer and closer to thinking and understanding what the customer and the business wants and needs.  As your project development you can start be in such harmony that you can consistently develop what they need  on the first try and even anticipate areas of improvement that will delight the business user.   To me, to get into the development zone and the customer zone at the same time is the really sweet spot.</p>

<p>What happens if you are just in you development zone and not in the customer zone?    Well, cranking out beautiful code that the doesn&rsquo;t serve the business needs is not beneficial.   Your code can be the most beautiful and elegant ever produced, but if it doesn&rsquo;t do it&rsquo;s job, what use is it?    What happens if you in the customer zone and have achieved a mind meld with your user and have internalized exactly what they need, but you get never get into your development groove.  Let&rsquo;s say for the sake of argument, you are constantly being interrupted and pulled into pointless meetings, so you can never concentrate long enough to get into the groove?  The code doesn&rsquo;t write itself.  It remains unrealized and of course that business never realizes the value either.</p>

<p>So, I think, really you need to get in two zone simultaneously to be the most productive developer that you can be.  Luckily, following an agile development process will get you there.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>How many minutes and hours have been wasted trying to decide if a ticket is a feature or a bug?  Yes, I have been there, entering a new item ticket, the dropdown in the tracker glares at me.  Decide!  Is is a bug or a feature.  Some are clear-cut, of course.  The ever popular null-pointer on unvalidated input for example.  But others are not so clear.   What about the field that you thought was supposed to viewable employees in the supervisor&rsquo;s location, but really ended up needing to be viewable to the employee&rsquo;s in the supervisor&rsquo;s location and the direct reports in another location?   The question then turns on whether or not this information was in the &ldquo;spec&rdquo; or whether the business user didn&rsquo;t let the developer know about it.  Now the question has created an ugly situation of &ldquo;blame&rdquo;.  Whose fault is it?</p>

<p>While I am all for development responsibility and testing, I think this line of thinking can only lead to trouble and harm the close relationship sought by the business user and the developer.  How can you truly have agile, collaborative development, if the two parties are at odds, even in the small sense of categorizing work tickets.  In the end, the same work needs to be done to get to the end result of having the application serve the business needs.  So let&rsquo;s lay off the blame game and just say no to bug vs feature.</p>
