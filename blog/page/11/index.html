  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>There was a question today on Twitter about how to go about finding the word with the most consecutive consonants in the dictionary file.  Of course, being a typical developer, when presented with a problem – I am usually not satisfied until I find a solution.  Since I am interested in learning Clojure, I thought I would try to solve this problem functionally.</p>

<p>Armed with Stuart Halloway&rsquo;s “Programming Clojure” and trusty Google by my side, I embarked on my first Clojure mission.</p>

<p>Starting small – I decided to tackle the issue of finding consecutive consonants in a word.  I found that re-seq handles regex very nicely</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt;  (re-seq #"[^aeiou]{2,}" "batty") 
("tty")
</code></pre>

<p>Building on … let&rsquo;s find the number of letters in this word.  Since we have a sequence – we need to get the first element off of it, convert it to a string and find the length of it</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt;  (.length (str (first (re-seq #"[^aeiou]{2,}" "batty"))))
3
</code></pre>

<p>Not bad – but let&rsquo;s turn this into a function now</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (defn count-cons [s]
   (.length (str (first  (re-seq #"[^aeiou]{2,}" s))))
 )
#'user/count-cons
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can call the function directly</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (count-cons "batty")
3
</code></pre>

<p>Alright – we are making progress.  Next step, we need to be able to compare two words and see which has the bigger consonant count and return that.  For this, we will need a little “if” magic.</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (defn compare-words [s1,s2]
(if (&gt; (count-cons s1) (count-cons s2))
  s1 s2))
#'user/compare-words
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s test it out</p>

<pre><code>#'user/compare-words
user=&gt; (compare-words "batty" "bat")
"batty"
user=&gt; (compare-words "bat" "batty")
"batty"
</code></pre>

<p>Oh, yes, we are getting to the good part now.  Since we have a function that we can call on two arguments and give us one back that we can work with – we are ready to pull out the big guns …. reduce!</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (reduce compare-words ["vat", "batty", "cars"])
"batty"
</code></pre>

<p>Yeah!  Next we just need to feed it a file.  For this, after doing some research, I used the duck-streams library – you need to load it in using</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (use '[clojure.contrib.duck-streams :only (spit read-lines)])

nil
</code></pre>

<p>We open the file and read the lines and feed it to our function</p>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (reduce compare-words (read-lines "/usr/share/dict/words"))

"Ångström"
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, my regex needs some tweaking - but for this exercise, I am content.</p>

<p>When you just have the working code.  It is actually quite concise:</p>

<pre><code>;Counting consecutive consonants

(use '[clojure.contrib.duck-streams :only (spit read-lines)])

(defn count-cons [s]
   (.length (str (first  (re-seq #"[^aeiou]{2,}" s))))
 )

(defn compare-words [s1,s2]
(if (&gt; (count-cons s1) (count-cons s2))
  s1 s2))

(reduce compare-words (read-lines "/usr/share/dict/words"))
</code></pre>

<p>All in all, a fun evening trying to think functionally.</p>

<p>Many moons ago, I spent a couple of years dancing with a ballet company.  You wouldn&rsquo;t think that much of that experience would transfer to development projects, but I give you an example in partnership, the can be applicable straight from the ballet world to the software world.  The partnership in question is the one between the lead ballerina and the lead male dancer called a “pas de deux.”  In many ballets, this dance involves the ballerina being a swan/princess and the male dancer being a prince/sorcerer.  But in my example, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter that much.  The only important point is that they are the best dancers in the whole company.</p>

<p>Each one of them can astound the audience in their solo moves, but in their duets – they can do really awesome things.  The male dancer supports the ballerina during dazzling spins and carries and lifts her in heart-stopping moves across the stage.  When it is done well, the audience goes crazy and gives them a standing ovation.  They can only pull off this spectacular performance if they have developed a great partnership.  Of course they are brilliant performers individually.  But they need more than that to pull of a pas de deux.   The job of the ballerina is to be lovely, graceful and technically brilliant.  The male partner must also to graceful and skillful (maybe not so lovely) – but his main job – is to make the ballerina look good.   Failure to make the ballerina look good – even if you are the most talented dancer in the entire universe – will still make you a lousy partner.    I don&rsquo;t care if he can spin one hundred times a second and can jump one hundred feet in the air.  If he is performing a pas de deux, and he drops his lovely ballerina on the floor, he is a lousy partner and she will be guaranteed to burn her toe shoes before agreeing to share the stage with him.</p>

<p>Reasons for being a bad partner in ballet (or dropping your ballerina):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You didn&rsquo;t have enough time to  rehearse</p></li>
<li><p>You don&rsquo;t like your ballerina</p></li>
<li><p>You think you should be a the star  of the show and don&rsquo;t want anyone to look better than you.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Now let&rsquo;s go to the world of the corporate software project.  You have your developers and your business partner – the customer.  You, the developers,  have the supporting role.  You main job is to make the customer look good.   That&rsquo;s right, through your mastery of technology, you must partner with your customer to help them accomplish their business goals and make them look great.   If you metaphorically,  drop your customer on the floor, then you are obviously not a good partner.</p>

<p>Reasons for being a bad developer partner in software projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>You are new to the team and     haven&rsquo;t gotten into the communication groove yet</li>
</ul>


<p>This is alright in the beginning of a project.  Heck, it happens when ballet dancers are just learning their dances too.  If you are doing short iteration cycles, then the first couple will be a little rough.  But with feedback you will improve and your team will start to gel and shift into high performance.</p>

<ul>
<li>You think all people that are not   IT are idiots.</li>
</ul>


<p>I have seen this sentiment common on projects that have a strict division between the IT people and the business people.  Somehow, it turns into a horrible sentiment that the anything that the business users ask for is a waste of time and only the IT department knows the right things to do.  If you have your team mixed with developers and business people this will help break down such harmful barriers.</p>

<ul>
<li>You think that you are a Superstar  and want to showcase your technical talents in your application –     maybe they will start asking you to speak at the Google Confs after     they see your work.</li>
</ul>


<p>You may be the Ninja Assassin of the Black Arts of Java, Ruby and all the cool Functional languages, but if you can&rsquo;t accomplish what your business needs to look good, then you suck as a partner.  Frequent communication with the customer is key.  Fun is fine, but please examine your motivations for putting in that cool new feature.  Is it going to make the customer look good or you?  Again, short iterations and feedback cycles will help put the focus back on what the customer wants and needs.</p>

<p>Communication, feedback  are essential elements to a good partnership in the ballet world and the software development world.  Don&rsquo;t ever forget to make your customer look good and your projects will be sure to get a standing ovation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>If you are trying to run ruby rvm and rails 3.0 on Ubuntu you might run into this problem when you start up you server.</p>

<pre><code>LoadError: no such file to load

</code></pre>

<p>After much googling and researching – just installing the openssl library on your system won&rsquo;t fix the problem.  You need to recompile and install your rvm ruby version with the openssl.  I found this fixed it for me.</p>

<pre><code>rvm install 1.9.2-p0 -C --with-openssl-dir=$rvm_path/usr
</code></pre>

<p>There is also another solution

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>In honor of the Ruby <a href="http://www.globalnerdy.com/2010/08/19/whyday-today-august-19th/">Why Day</a>, I was inspired to dabble in Ruby Blocks after being reading &ldquo;Fox In Socks&rdquo; multiple times to my children before bed.  For all of you parents out there that have read the book many, many times while your children are giggling at your pronunciation difficulties, I am sure this bit will be familiar:</p>

<pre><code>def fox_in_socks_blocks
  chicks_bricks = ["Chicks","bricks","blocks","clocks"]
  yield chicks_bricks[0..1]
  yield [chicks_bricks[0],chicks_bricks[2]]
  yield chicks_bricks
end

fox_in_socks_blocks do |sillywords|
  puts "#{sillywords[0]} with #{sillywords[1]} come." if sillywords.size &lt; 3
  puts "#{sillywords[0]} with #{sillywords[1]} and #{sillywords[2]} and #{sillywords[3]} come." if sillywords.size &gt;= 3
end
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s right - the output is:
<code>
Chicks with bricks come.
Chicks with blocks come.
Chicks with bricks and blocks and clocks come.
</code></p>

<p>Is your tongue numb?</p>

<p>Happy Why Day!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I am cruising along in my morning.  I have a cup of tea in my hand and a good outlook on my tasks at hand.  The code is flowing off of my fingertips.  I am feeling pretty smart.  Then the cloud moves in and the code darkens.  I am at a roadblock.   I try to google, I try debugging, I try calling in my fellow developers to see if they can see what the problem is&hellip; no luck.  I bang my head unproductively for another hour and then go home.  A fresh start in the morning and a fresh cup of day move me in a new direction, somehow I stumble upon the answer and quite frankly, it was so simple I can&rsquo;t believe I missed it.  I feel not so smart.   This is one of the many smart-not-so-smart waves that rule the life of a developer.</p>

<p>The example above is what I would call a mini-smart-not-so-smart wave.  There are much bigger ones too and much more important too.  These are the sort of moments that you encounter that you feel stupid in a really good way.   You learn a totally new approach or way of doing things and much better because of it.   One of these moments was when I went up to a MySQL  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ZendCon/sql-query-tuning-the-legend-of-drunken-query-master-presentation">Drunken Query Master Presentation </a>by Jay Pipes.  He is a brilliant speaker.  Before I went up there, I thought I was pretty smart.  I knew how to swing inner and outer joins on my queries and how to optimize using the explain plan&hellip;. After listening to him, I felt really not so smart.   I had been using Theta style instead of Ansi style in my queries and I really had no idea of how to use the storage engines properly and really understand how the optimizer worked or even more important&hellip; to really do queries well, you need to stop thinking in logic loops (the comfortable world of the developer) and start thinking in sets.   Yes, I felt really dim, but my world view had grown and I had found a whole range of stuff that I didn&rsquo;t know.   I had uncovered a whole dark section  “how do you know what you don&rsquo;t know”.</p>

<p>I had similar experiences when I attended some OWASP security talks and realized that I really didn&rsquo;t know much about software security and it is actually quite important to learn and consider in design and development to make better more robust software.  More recently, I have been spending my not-so-smart cycle time learning more about Test-Driven Design and Agile development by learning Ruby and attending some awesome local community user groups.</p>

<p>So, if you are feeling smart and have been for awhile.  It is really time to look around for something to challenge you views.  Look at a completely different field in technology then you are used to, try QA, project management, security, cloud computing, data governance.  Go out in the community and talk to people in user groups.   Push yourself of in the not-so-smart wave section and you will emerge smarter and happier for it.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I have always wanted to contribute to Open Source.  I have reaped the benefits of using Open Source packages throughout the years, I sincerely want to give back.  What has been stopping me all this time?      Lack of time is my main excuse.  I have two small children and by the time I clean up from dinner and get them bathed and off to bed, there is little time left to code.   I tend to use this excuse for lots of other tasks that I avoid around the house, like closet cleaning, reorganizing the garage, etc …  But an excuse is exactly what it is.</p>

<p>I learned an invaluable technique to tackling projects around the house that I would like to get done, but seem too large or for some other reason have become subject to procrastination.  First, I schedule a day to do something about it and then I put on a timer and just start doing it for 15 minutes.  After 15 minutes, I am officially done.  I can quit with no guilt and have the lovely feeling of having made a dent.  Most often, once I get started, I want to keep with it and really get rolling.  That&rsquo;s OK too.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday, I decided to apply this technique and made a date with Open Source.  After a Ruby user group, the night before,  demonstrated the mechanics of fixing a bug using GitHub, I was finally confident enough to give it a go myself.  I created a GitHub account, forked the Redmine project, fixed a bite-sized bug and submitted a patch – all in one night!</p>

<p>I was so jazzed up about it, that I decided that I was going to continue in my Open Source contribution quest on a limited time budget, by declaring that my Wednesday night is my Open Source night.  It might only be 15 or 30 min, but I will be doing something and feeling that contribution buzz goodness.</p>

<p>I encourage everyone that has been struggling to find time for Open Source to just schedule one night a week.  Just do something for 15 min and see what flows …</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I decided to start playing with RDFs to start me on the road to understanding and programming Semantic Web.  As always, the first step it to start with a “Hello World” type of exercise.  In my case, I had armed myself with a good cappuccino at Starbucks and decided to set myself with a purl link and FOAF page.
<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/FOAF_%28software%29">
FOAF (Friend of a Friend)</a> is one of the most popular vocabularies out there for RDF (Resource Description Framework).  It expresses relationships in a machine readable format and is considered one of the first social Semantic Web applications.</p>

<p>When you look at a foaf.rdf file, it is basically just an file with xml tags:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;foaf:Person rdf:ID="me"&gt;
&lt;foaf:name&gt;Carin Meier&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
&lt;foaf:givenname&gt;Carin&lt;/foaf:givenname&gt;
&lt;foaf:family_name&gt;Meier&lt;/foaf:family_name&gt;
&lt;foaf:nick&gt;squid&lt;/foaf:nick&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Not too much fun to start coding by hand though.  Luckily, there is a handy dandy generator - <a href="http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic">FOAF-a-matic.</a> Just fill in the form and you can easily generate the basic foaf rdf file for yourself.  You can always add to it later.  Save the file as foaf.rdf somewhere on your website for indexing.</p>

<p>Now you can do some fun stuff with it.  You can check and visualize your RDF document with <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/">http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/</a>.  Or you can use a<a href="http://foaf-visualizer.org/?uri=http://gigasquidsoftware.com/foaf/foaf.rdf"> FOAF visualizer</a>.</p>

<p>The final part is to set yourself up with a purl address.  <a href="http://www.purl.org/docs/index.html">Purl.org</a> is a website that is dedicated to providing web endpoints or addresses that can be indentifiers for individuals.  It provides a layer of indirection that is very useful in the changing world of the web.  For example, if I use my work web page link as my identifier in my RDF and then I change jobs, all my FOAF links will be broken.  However, I can use my purl address and set up my identifier as my webpage and then change it when then need arises.   So logon to purl.org and set yourself up with an account.
When other people &ldquo;know&rdquo; you in FOAF, they can use your purl link:</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I attended my first NFJS conference last weekend up in Columbus.  Overall, it was an excellent experience.   The speakers were all first rate and I got a chance to hang out and meet some other like-minded people who are interested in giving up a weekend to learn new technologies and generally just geek-out.</p>

<p>The main technologies that stood out to me are concurrency and semantic web.   Concurrency and functional programming are becoming more and more important with the ability to scale out on the server, rather then scale up (horizontal vs vertical scaling).    There is always some threshold to the amount of power that you can throw at one system.  However, that limit disappears if you can spread the load out across many servers.  Java runs into some real problems with threads and concurrency.  For this reason, the functional languages like Scala, Erlang, and Clojure are really starting to shine.   I was so impressed with Clojure, that I picked up a book for my “play around and take a look at” tech stack.</p>

<p>The highlight of the conference for me was on Sunday.  I was fortunate enough to attend all of Brian Sletten&rsquo;s sessions on REST, RDF,  and all things Semantic Web.   I was interested in the Semantic Web before I attended, but afterwards it is my new love.   I have always been interested in databases and datasets, so discovering a technology that enriches data in a open distributed way across the web just made me giddy.   The potential enterprise applications are very exciting.  When RDF is combined with a HATEOS architecture, you have can have a robust, scalable, agile architecture that can integrate data across many different systems and datasources.   These rich datasources can be sliced and diced for reporting and BI and can also be secured by row/ column level like security.    On the e-commerce side of the Internet, even very simple implementations of  RDF vocabularies are yielding very promising results.  Best Buy put in a semantic web vocabulary on their website that resulted in 30% increase of sales.   It is a very exciting time for semantic web technologies.  I am a firm believer in that it is “ all about the data”.   I think for the future it will be more like “Why have just data when you can have data with context?”</p>

<p>All in all, I had a great time and it was definitely worth the trip up to Columbus for the weekend.  If you have chance to check out NFJS or any stuff about the Semantic Web or Functional Languages, go for it.  You will enjoy it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3833/9925947563_50031edb46_o.jpg"></p>

<p>I have been attending talks on functional programming languages at NFJS over the past couple of days.  I have to admit it, I am really taken with the power of Scala and Clojure to tackle problems that Java cannot handle.  I even purchased a Clojure book to add to my &ldquo;languages to take a good hard look at&rdquo; stack.   I really believe that it is true that the functional languages have a lot to offer.</p>

<p> However, let&rsquo;s not loose track of one really powerful tool that the Object Oriented world provides to us.   This is the way to model the world in a more natural way.  Since we do this all the time in Java and other object oriented languages, we take it for granted now.   But the advantage that this modeling the world in our mind and our code is tremendous.  One of the biggest constraint on developing software is the ability to hold in our minds the mental model of what the code is doing and how it is doing it.  Once, you do this – you “know the application”.   Having the ability to break the world up into chunks that more easily fit allows us to more naturally build applications without the complexity drowning us out.</p>

<p>I am wary of the temptation to “throw the baby out with the bathwater” to go to pure functional and leave objects behind.  This is way Scala seems like a pragmatic solution, since it allows you to turn the dial back and forth from the Object Oriented way of doing things to the functional side.</p>

<p>That being said, I still intend to learn Clojure next instead of Scala.  Why?  Because to learn a new language that is a new way of thinking, I would prefer not to have an alternative way to fall back to old familiar ways of thinking.  That way you can really get a new perspective on things to see what the true functional side has to offer.  And no, I am not hard core enough to learn Haskell.</p>

<p>One thing is for sure.  The future is multi-core.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I think most developers are familiar with getting in the “zone”.  The place you get when you are totally in focus and in the flow of development.  The code comes quickly, the ideas are together and everything just seems to work.  It is the sweet spot of productivity.  I have found the best way for me to get into the zone is to put on my headphones, arrange some uninterrupted time and just start going.</p>

<p>There is another zone, however, that I think is just as important.  This is getting into the zone with the customer.  At the beginning of a project, or even just joining a new company, you have to get to know your customer.  It involves a lot of learning the business rules, processes, and just plain communication style.  In these early stages, there is a bound to be some misunderstandings.  This is where the iterative development process really shines.   With each feedback cycle, you get closer and closer to thinking and understanding what the customer and the business wants and needs.  As your project development you can start be in such harmony that you can consistently develop what they need  on the first try and even anticipate areas of improvement that will delight the business user.   To me, to get into the development zone and the customer zone at the same time is the really sweet spot.</p>

<p>What happens if you are just in you development zone and not in the customer zone?    Well, cranking out beautiful code that the doesn&rsquo;t serve the business needs is not beneficial.   Your code can be the most beautiful and elegant ever produced, but if it doesn&rsquo;t do it&rsquo;s job, what use is it?    What happens if you in the customer zone and have achieved a mind meld with your user and have internalized exactly what they need, but you get never get into your development groove.  Let&rsquo;s say for the sake of argument, you are constantly being interrupted and pulled into pointless meetings, so you can never concentrate long enough to get into the groove?  The code doesn&rsquo;t write itself.  It remains unrealized and of course that business never realizes the value either.</p>

<p>So, I think, really you need to get in two zone simultaneously to be the most productive developer that you can be.  Luckily, following an agile development process will get you there.</p>
