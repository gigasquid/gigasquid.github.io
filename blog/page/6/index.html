<p>White: a Blank Page or Canvas.</p>

<p>As I spent a pleasant Sunday outside doing yard work, songs from one of my favorite musicals, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_in_the_Park_with_George">“Sunday in the Park with George”</a>, came to mind. While the songs were playing in my head, my thoughts again drifted to one of my favorite programming languages, Clojure. To my surprise, I was struck by similarities between the musical, which is about the artist Geroges Seuret and his creation of one of his famous painting, and that of the functional JVM language of Clojure. Granted, musicals, art and programming languages don&rsquo;t generally get discussed together, but please humor me and let me elaborate. Following the thread of my inspiration, I will be using the first few opening lines from the musical as my headings and guides for my discussion.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the broad subjects of Art and Software. They are both created. We use our tools, palettes and techniques to create representations of the world. The visual artist portrays this representation in paints and on canvas, while the software developer uses programming languages and computers.</p>

<p>Looking back in time, we see that there are many different styles of painting that have developed over time. From flat, idealized Byzantine Art to that of the incredible realistic detail of Renaissance Dutch portrait masters. These styles were a reflection of not only the techniques and materials of the time, but also an outlook on the world and the way the artist represented it. Likewise, software styles also have differed over time. From the procedural BASIC language to the current dominant style of Object Oriented programming, the styles are a reflection of not only the technology available to us, but in the way that we model real world concepts and processes into the digital space.</p>

<h2>The Challenge: Bring Order to the Whole.</h2>

<p>Georges Seuret was interested in the optic effect when two small points of different color placed close to one another, would seem to create a third new and luminous color when viewed at a distance. He innovated a technique called pointillism, and created a whole painting composed of tiny dots of color. The striking effect of this can be seen in his famous, large scale painting titled &ldquo;A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte”.</p>

<p>In his use of pointillism, Seuret turned to simplicity to create order and achieve complexity. By breaking the painting down into the essence of dots of colors, he opened the way for a sort of parallelism in color viewing by the user, which ended up giving the viewer a perception of richer colors. This very technique, enhanced by todays technology is of course the basis of our incredible RGB viewing in our televisions and monitors.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s turn to Clojure. Clojure is a functional language that is interested with concurrency. It also turns to simplicity to achieve complexity. By breaking things down and simplifying to more pure functions with immutable data structures, it make the complex problem of parallel programming possible. This is something that is very hard in the Object Oriented world view programming model. In my opinion, Clojure&rsquo;s approach to concurrent complexity with simplicity is an important innovation to our world of software, just as pointillism was to the world of art. To better explain, let&rsquo;s walk though some of the language features.</p>

<h2>Through Design</h2>

<p>Rich Hickey designed Clojure as a general-purpose language. He wanted it to combine some of best parts of a scripting language – the approachability and interactive development with a REPL – with an infrastructure that would be fast, robust and support multithreaded programming.</p>

<h2>Composition</h2>

<p>The language itself is a LISP. It gains the benefits of the simplicity of syntax of the code as data as well as having the power of Macros that allows one to customize the language. The beauty of this simplicity and conciseness allows one to focuses more on the code that matters.</p>

<h2>Tension</h2>

<p>Pure functions and immutable state is great, but to most things you will need some sort of state. Clojure also provides ways to use mutable state and still support correct multithreaded designs. It uses Software Transaction Memory System and Agents to achieve this. This use of mutable state in a controlled and isolated way, allows clean, efficient and concurrent programming.</p>

<h2>Balance</h2>

<p>Clojure embraces the JVM as it&rsquo;s platform. This pragmatic approach gives not only gives the language a scalable, proven run time environment, it also gives it the advantage of accessing Java&rsquo;s many mature libraries through wrapper free interoperability.</p>

<h2>Light</h2>

<p>Clojure language is a joy to learn. Being concise and a LISP, is very regular in it&rsquo;s syntax. There are only a few key data structures and forms to learn to really get started.</p>

<h2>and Harmony.</h2>

<p>Clojure has an awesome community. The level of enthusiasm and innovation among the Clojure open source developers is inspiring. Every day seems to bring a new development or contribution. There is ClojureScript for JavaScript development, Noir for web development, Logic programming just to name a few.</p>

<p>In summary, innovation in art and technology can come through a quest for simplification. This very act of simplification, then allows for breakthroughs in complexity. Both Seuret and Hickey have shared in this vision in both their art and software.</p>

<p>Finally, I highly recommend watching “Sunday in the Park with George” if you haven&rsquo;t seen it yet. I also highly recommend looking at Clojure too. In fact, you might want to try some <a href="https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans">Clojure Koans</a> before watching the show. You might enjoy it from a different perspective&hellip;</p>

		<p>Long ago,  I worked for a couple years as a professional ballet dancer with a small company. Reflecting on this, I have an interesting perspective of working in field were woman are the majority and also one where women are in the minority. I thought I would dedicate this post a few observations of similarities between men in ballet and women in software development.</p>

<p><strong>Men in Ballet</strong>
<img class="left" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3786/9925846994_2673f8183c_o.jpg"></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Have some lame people think ballet is just for girls and make assumptions about them based on cultural stereotypes</p></li>
<li><p>Have to have a sense of humor to handle accidentally injuries due to kicks or slips while rehearsing choreography with women.</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly love what they do. Otherwise, they most likely would have never overcome the social pressure to pursue their craft.</p></li>
<li><p>Partner when ballerinas to create great performances. The diversity of having men and women dance together allows more freedom of expression in the choreography. Ultimately, that produces a show that is more valuable and pleasing to the audience.</p></li>
<li><p>Usually have no wait in line for the men&rsquo;s restroom during ballet performance intermissions.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Women in Software Development</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Have some lame people think software development is just for boys and make assumptions about them based on cultural stereotypes.</p></li>
<li><p>Have to have a sense of humor to handle accidental insensitive remarks due to slips in conversation when working with men. (Ex: hot chicks, rude jokes, etc&hellip;.)</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly love what they do. Otherwise, they most likely would have never overcome the social pressure to pursue their craft.</p></li>
<li><p>Partner with other software developers to create great software. More diversity*, allows more freedom of expression in understanding and applying technology to solve business needs. Ultimately, that produces software that is more valuable and pleasing to the business and user.</p></li>
<li><p>Usually have no wait in line for the women&rsquo;s restroom during technical conference breaks.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>*And yes, the diversity I am talking about is not limited to just men and women.</p>

		<p>Since joining EdgeCase, I have shelved my heavy Intellij and Eclipse IDEs in favor of Emacs. Overall, I have enjoyed moving to the light-weight but powerful editor. There is one thing that I did miss from my IDEs – that was the ability to search projects for string occurrences and being able to click navigate to them through the editor. Fortunately, one of the strengths of Emacs is it&rsquo;s infinite configurability and extensibility. Even more fortunate, one of the guys in our shared office, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dougalcorn">Doug Alcorn</a> of Gaslight Software, had already written just this feature for his Emacs. I installed it and was so pleased with it, that I thought I would share …</p>

		<p>I got the chance to share my enthusiasm for two of my favorite technologies at JRubyConf by giving a presentation on Semantic Web and JRuby. It was an excellent experience. I was able to connect with other people that shared my interest in the Semantic Web and some that have even worked with the technologies professionally. Most exciting, I had the opportunity to share my knowledge and hopefully inspire others to look farther into using JRuby with the Jena Semantic Web Framework.</p>

<p>Here are some resources from the presentation that I wanted to share with everyone:</p>

<p>On github, <a href="https://github.com/gigasquid/jruby_semantic_web_examples">https://github.com/gigasquid/jruby_semantic_web_examples</a>, I put together some examples of SPARQL queries against dbpedia as well as translating the examples that they have on the <a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/tutorial/RDF_API/index.html">Jena RDF API</a> to use JRuby</p>

<p>Here is the presentation itself:
<a href="https://github.com/gigasquid/Presentations/blob/master/SemanticWebJRuby.pdf">https://github.com/gigasquid/Presentations/blob/master/SemanticWebJRuby.pdf</a></p>

<p>A special note of thanks to <a href="http://foaf-visualizer.org/?uri=http://purl.org/net/bsletten">Brian Sletten</a>, the Semantic Web guru, who inspired and exposed me to the Semantic Web, helped me out by answering my questions and pointing me in the right direction and for just being a swell guy.</p>

		<p>Deploying Clojure apps with a single command to the cloud is now possible with Heroku Cedar and let me tell you, it is pure joy.</p>

<p>I experimented with this the other day by creating a Compojure web application that compares the followers that two twitter users have in common.</p>

<p>Here is the secret sauce you need to push your apps to Heroku:</p>

<p>1) <strong>Procfile: </strong>
You need to create a file in the root of your directory that contains the way to start up your application:</p>

<pre><code> web: lein run -m ring-twitter-common.core
</code></pre>

<p>2) The application must have the project.clj setup correctly so that you can just run:</p>

<pre><code>lein deps
</code></pre>

<p>3) You need to install the <a href="https://github.com/heroku/heroku">Heroku gem</a></p>

<p>Once you have this setup you simply do:</p>

<pre><code>heroku create --stack cedar




git push heroku master
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. Your webapp will auto-magically be created, and deployed and be available for your viewing pleasure.</p>

<p>You can check out  my sample Twitter Heroku app here:
<a href="http://ring-twitter-common.herokuapp.com/">http://ring-twitter-common.herokuapp.com/</a></p>

<p>But wait, you say&hellip; wouldn&rsquo;t it be awesome if you could just write your Clojure app and say lein deploy and have it all work? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be super awesome if there was some command to generate a skeleton for your Compojure app? The solution is actually in the planning stages by James Reeves (weavejester)!  Hooray!</p>

<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/leiningen/browse_thread/thread/1f3fbb808542adc6">Leiningen Google Group Text</a></p>

<p>In summary:  Developing Clojure Web Apps just got easier and the future is only looking up :)</p>

		<p>I have been happily using <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> and <a href="https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery">Jasmine-JQuery</a> on a project with great success. However, I was still unsure about how to handle mocking the ajax calls back to the server. It turns out the answer is already in Jasmine. Time to call out the spies!</p>

<p>There is a wiki page on spies <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/wiki/Spies">https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/wiki/Spies</a>, but I always enjoy a nice code sample.</p>

<p>In my source file I have an ajax call that I would like to mock that looks like this:
[gist id=957387]</p>

<p>Now in my spec file &ndash; I setup a spy on the ajax call and use andCallFake to mock the call. When the method is tested, the ajax call will be mocked and return through the success handler. You can pass data back through the fakeData var.

		<p>Lately, I have been working on the awesome open source project <a href="http://www.4clojure.com/">4Clojure.com</a>. The site helps you to learn Clojure by solving “koan” type problems in an interactive format. One of the enhancements that I was looking at putting in was a way to enter code in a text box and have it color highlight as type. I found the <a href="http://ace.ajax.org/">ACE project</a>, which looked like exactly what I wanted. However, sad panda, they didn&rsquo;t have a Clojure mode. Not deterred, I decided that I would try to take a crack at it. I ported most of the rules from the Clojure brush in Syntax Highlighter over and implemented some basic auto-indent.</p>

<p>The Github source has been added to the main project at Ace <a href="https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace">https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace</a>
You can see it in action on the 4Clojure.com site here: <a href="http://www.4clojure.com/problem/14">http://www.4clojure.com/problem/14</a></p>

		<p>I have put a couple projects out on GitHub to help people get started with Clojure and Ruby.
The Katas are taken more or less from the Coding Kata site <a href="http://codingkata.org/katas/">http://codingkata.org/katas/</a>. The projects both include the basic project setup for you to get started with TDD beginner katas.</p>

<p>The Ruby project has tests in the form of rspec-given, which is quite fun. The Clojure project has tests in the form of Midje, which has a lovely syntax.</p>

<p>Please give them a try :)</p>

		<p>Recently, I decided to work on a set of code Katas.  I couldn&rsquo;t decide whether to do them in Ruby or Clojure, so I decided to do them in both.  I did the Kata in Ruby first and then immediately followed up with the same one in Clojure.  It was an interesting exercise, not only for the learning of the languages, but to highlight how I thought about the problems differently depending on the language.</p>

<p>Ruby is a fantastic language.  It would delight and sometimes surprise me with how elegant and natural it was to solve problems.  When I approached the Kata, I found myself thinking, “How can I make this more readable?”.   Ruby never failed to please.</p>

<p>Clojure is also a wonderful language.  One of the things that I really enjoy about it is that it changed that way that I approach problems.  This was particularly evident when I turned to solve the same problem in Ruby that I just had in Clojure.  First and foremost, I thought about the data.  Then about how the data could be transformed.  The transformation isn&rsquo;t like the serial steps that you normally take to hold the data in your hand and bit by bit mold it into the result – like a sculptor with clay.  It is the kind of transformation that takes a rolled ball of yarn and transforms into a beautiful lace pattern.</p>

<p>The closest that I had come to this functional way of thinking was when I was doing some heavy SQL and database work.  I went to a talk by Jay Pipes on MySQL.  I remember him saying that to be really good at SQL, you needed to think in sets.  You couldn&rsquo;t effectively solve the queries with the regular programming for-loop construct.  You needed to think of the sets of data joining and intersecting and the transformations needed to be applied to the data elements.  The same focus on the data seemed to hold true for Clojure too.</p>

<p>I highly recommend both Ruby and Clojure as programming languages.  Each are dynamic, elegant and powerful and a lot of fun.  Next time you sit down to do a Kata, and can&rsquo;t decide what language to use, try them both – and let me know how you think&hellip;</p>
