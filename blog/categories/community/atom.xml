    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Why do you devote time and participate in the community?</h2>

<p>1) <em>Why do you devote time and participate in the community?</em></p>

<p>I find joy in coding and making things. I want to be around other
people who feel the same way.</p>

<p>2) <em>Why?</em></p>

<p>Because I want to be inspired by others and learn from others and hope that they are inspired and learn from me.</p>

<p>3) <em>Why?</em></p>

<p>Because ideas and learning doesn&rsquo;t happen in a vacuum. There is something magical about the serendipity of human interaction and that needs a community to take place.</p>

<p>4) <em>Why?</em></p>

<p>It is all fundamentally about people. People dream. We talk about our dreams and get together and make them reality. That is the magic of our civilization.</p>

<p>5) <em>Why?</em></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to dream alone.</p>

<p>What are your reasons?
