    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OoqsrMD7JzXAvRUGx_8_fg.jpeg">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OoqsrMD7JzXAvRUGx_8_fg.jpeg</a>"></p>

<p>This is the beginning of a series of blog posts to get to know the <a href="https://mxnet.apache.org/">Apache MXNet</a> Deep Learning project and the new Clojure language binding <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/contrib/clojure-package">clojure-package</a></p>

<p>MXNet is a first class, modern deep learning library that AWS has officially picked as its chosen library. It supports multiple languages on a first class basis and is incubating as an Apache project.</p>

<p>The motivation for creating a Clojure package is to be able to open the deep learning library to the Clojure ecosystem and build bridges for future development and innovation for the community. It provides all the needed tools including low level and high level apis, dynamic graphs, and things like GAN and natural language support.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s get on with our introduction with one of the basic building blocks of MXNet, the <code>NDArray</code>.</p>

<h2>Meet NDArray</h2>

<p>The <code>NDArray</code> is the tensor data structure in MXNet. Let&rsquo;s start of by creating one. First we need to require the <code>ndarray</code> namespace:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(ns tutorial.ndarray
  (:require [org.apache.clojure-mxnet.ndarray :as ndarray]))
</code></p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s create an all zero array of dimension 100 x 50</p>

<p><code>clojure
(ndarray/zeros [100 50])
;=&gt; #object[org.apache.mxnet.NDArray 0x3e396d0 "org.apache.mxnet.NDArray@aeea40b6"]
</code></p>

<p>We can check the shape of this by using <code>shape-vec</code></p>

<p><code>clojure
(ndarray/shape-vec (ndarray/zeros [100 50]))
;=&gt; [100 50]
</code></p>

<p>There is also a quick way to create an ndarray of ones with the <code>ones</code> function:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(ndarray/ones [256 32 128 1])
</code></p>

<p>Ones and zeros are nice, but what an array with specific contents? There is an <code>array</code> function for that. Specific the contents of the array first and the shape second:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(def c (ndarray/array [1 2 3 4 5 6] [2 3]))
(ndarray/shape-vec c)  ;=&gt; [2 3]
</code></p>

<p>To convert it back to a vector format, we can use the <code>-&gt;vec</code> function.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(ndarray/-&gt;vec c)
;=&gt; [1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0]
</code></p>

<p>Now that we know how to create NDArrays, we can get to do something interesting like operations on them.</p>

<h3>Operations</h3>

<p>There are all the standard arithmetic operations:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(def a (ndarray/ones [1 5]))
(def b (ndarray/ones [1 5]))
(-&gt; (ndarray/+ a b) (ndarray/-&gt;vec))
;=&gt;  [2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0]
</code></p>

<p>Note that the original ndarrays are unchanged.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(ndarray/-&gt;vec a) ;=&gt; [1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0]
(ndarray/-&gt;vec b) ;=&gt; [1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0]
</code></p>

<p>But, we can change that if we use the inplace operators:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(ndarray/+= a b)
(ndarray/-&gt;vec a) ;=&gt;  [2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0]
</code></p>

<p>There are many more operations, but just to give you a taste, we&rsquo;ll take a look a the <code>dot</code> product operation:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(def arr1 (ndarray/array [1 2] [1 2]))
(def arr2 (ndarray/array [3 4] [2 1]))
(def res (ndarray/dot arr1 arr2))
(ndarray/shape-vec res) ;=&gt; [1 1]
(ndarray/-&gt;vec res) ;=&gt; [11.0]
</code></p>

<p>If you are curious about the other operators available in NDArray API check out the <a href="https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/ndarray/ndarray.html">MXNet project documentation page</a></p>

<p>Now that we have ndarrays and can do calculations on them, we might want to save and load them.</p>

<h3>Saving and Loading</h3>

<p>You can save ndarrays with a name as a map like:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(ndarray/save "filename" {"arr1" arr1 "arr2" arr2})
</code></p>

<p>To load them, you just specify the filename and the map is returned.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(ndarray/load "filename")
;=&gt; {"arr1" #object[org.apache.mxnet.NDArray 0x1b629ff4 "org.apache.mxnet.NDArray@63da08cb"]
;=&gt;  "arr2" #object[org.apache.mxnet.NDArray 0x25d994e3 "org.apache.mxnet.NDArray@5bbaf2c3"]}
</code></p>

<p>One more cool thing, we can even due our operations on the cpu or gpu.</p>

<h3>Multi-Device Support</h3>

<p>When creating an <code>ndarray</code> you can use a context argument to specify the device. To do this, we will need the help of the <code>context</code> namespace.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(require '[org.apache.clojure-mxnet.context :as context])
</code></p>

<p>By default, the <code>ndarray</code> is created on the cpu context.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(def cpu-a (ndarray/zeros [100 200]))
(ndarray/context cpu-a)
;=&gt; #object[ml.dmlc.mxnet.Context 0x3f376123 "cpu(0)"]
</code></p>

<p>But we can specify the gpu instead, (if we have a gpu enabled build).</p>

<p><code>clojure
(def gpu-b (ndarray/zeros [100 200] {:ctx (context/gpu 0)}))
</code></p>

<p><em>Note: Operations among different contexts are currently not allowed, but there is a <code>copy-to</code> function that can help copy the content from one device to another and then continue on with the computation.</em></p>

<h2>Wrap up</h2>

<p>I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed the brief introduction to the MXNet library, there is much more to explore in future posts. If you are interested in giving it a try, there are native jars for OSX cpu and Linux cpu/gpu available and the code for the ndarray tutorial can be found <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/contrib/clojure-package/examples/tutorial">here</a></p>

<p><em>Please remember that the library is in a experimential state, so if you encounter any problems or have any other feedback, please log an issue so bugs and rough edges can be fixed :).</em></p>

    <link href="http://gigasquid.github.io/blog/2017/11/07/cats-and-dogs-with-cortex-redux/"/>
    <updated>2017-11-07T18:51:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://gigasquid.github.io/blog/2017/11/07/cats-and-dogs-with-cortex-redux</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wrote a <a href="http://gigasquidsoftware.com/blog/2016/12/27/deep-learning-in-clojure-with-cortex/">blog post</a> a while back about using a Clojure machine learning library called <a href="https://github.com/thinktopic/cortex">Cortex</a> to do the Kaggle Cats and Dogs classification challenge.</p>

<p>I wanted to revisit it for a few reasons. The first one is that the Cortex library has progressed and improved considerably over the last year. It&rsquo;s still not at version 1.0, but it my eyes, it&rsquo;s really starting to shine. The second reason is that they recently published an <a href="https://github.com/thinktopic/cortex/tree/master/examples/resnet-retrain">example</a> of using the RESNET50 model, (I&rsquo;ll explain later on), to do fine-tuning or transfer learning. The third reason, is that there is a great new plugin for leiningen the supports using <a href="https://github.com/didiercrunch/lein-jupyter">Jupyter notebooks with Clojure projects</a>. These notebooks are a great way of doing walkthroughs and tutorials.</p>

<p>Putting all these things together, I felt like I was finally at a stage where I could somewhat replicate the first lesson in the <a href="https://github.com/fastai/courses/blob/master/deeplearning1/nbs/dogs_cats_redux.ipynb">Practical Deep Learning Course for Coders</a> with Cats and Dogs &ndash; although this time all in Clojure!</p>

<h2>Where to Start?</h2>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://kaggle2.blob.core.windows.net/competitions/kaggle/3362/media/woof_meow.jpg">http://kaggle2.blob.core.windows.net/competitions/kaggle/3362/media/woof_meow.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>In the last blog post, we created our deep learning network and trained the data on scaled down images (like 50x50) from scratch. This time we are much smarter.</p>

<p>We are still of course going to have to get a hold of all the training data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data">Kaggle Cats vs Dogs Challenge</a>. The big difference is this time, we are just going to have to train our model for <em>1 epoch</em>. What&rsquo;s more, the results will be way better than before.</p>

<p>How is this possible? We are going to use an already trained model, RESNET50. This model has already been painstakingly trained with a gigantic network that is 50 layers deep on the ImageNet challenge. That&rsquo;s a challenge that has models try to classify a 1000 different categories. The theory is that the inner layers of the network have already learned about the features that make up cats and dogs, all we would need to do is peel off the final layer of the network and graft on a new layers that just learns the final classification for our 2 categories of cats and dogs. This is called <em>transfer learning</em> or <em>retraining</em>.</p>

<h2>Plan of Action</h2>

<ul>
<li>Get all the cats and dogs pictures in the right directory format for training</li>
<li>Train the model with all but the last layer in the RESNET model. The last layer we are going to replace with our own layer that will finetune it to classify only cats and dogs</li>
<li>Run the test data and come up with a spreadsheet of results to submit to Kaggle.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Getting all the data pictures in the right format</h3>

<p>This is the generally the most time consuming step of most deep learning. I&rsquo;ll spare you the gritty details but we want to get all the pictures from the <code>train.zip</code> into the format</p>

<p>```
-data
  -cats-dogs-training</p>

<pre><code>  -cat
      1110.png
      ...
  -dog
      12416.png
      ...
</code></pre>

<p>  -cats-dogs-testing</p>

<pre><code>  -cat
      11.png
      ...
  -dog
      12.png
      ...
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The image sizes must also all be resized to match the input of the RESNET50. That means they all have to be 224x224.</p>

<h3>Train the model</h3>

<p>The cortex functions allow you to load the resnet50 model, remove the last layer, freeze all the other layers so that they will not be retrained, and add new layers.</p>

<p>I was surprised that I could actually train the model with all the images at 224x244 with the huge RESNET50 model. I built the uberjar and ran it which helped the performance.</p>

<p><code>lein uberjar</code></p>

<p><code>java -jar target/cats-dogs-cortex-redux.jar</code></p>

<p>Training one epoch took me approximately 6 minutes. Not bad, especially considering that&rsquo;s all the training I really needed to do.</p>

<p><code>
Loss for epoch 1: (current) 0.05875186542016347 (best) null
Saving network to trained-network.nippy
</code></p>

<p>The key point is that it saved the fine tuned network to trained-network.nippy</p>

<h3>Run the Kaggle test results and submit the results</h3>

<p>You will need to do a bit more setup for this. First, you need to get the Kaggle test images for classification. There are 12500 of these in the test.zip file from the site. Under the data directory, create a new directory called kaggle-test. Now unzip the contents of test.zip inside that folder. The full directory with all the test images should now be:</p>

<p><code>data/kaggle-test/test</code></p>

<p>This step takes a long time and you might have to tweak the batch size again depending on your memory. There are 12500 predications to be made. The main logic for this is in function called <code>(kaggle-results batch-size)</code>. It will take a long time to run. It will print the results as it goes along to the kaggle-results.csv file. If you want to check progress you can do wc -l kaggle-results.csv</p>

<p>For me locally, with <code>(cats-dogs/kaggle-results 100)</code> it took me 28 minutes locally.</p>

<h3>Compare the results</h3>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4518/26477015609_1af781b8da_b.jpg">http://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4518/26477015609_1af781b8da_b.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>My one epoch of fine tuning beat my best results of going through the Practical Deep Learning exercise with the fine tuning the VGG16 model. Not bad at all.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>For those of you that are interested in checking out the code, it&rsquo;s out there on <a href="https://github.com/gigasquid/cats-dogs-cortex-redux">github</a></p>

<p>Even more exciting, there is a <a href="https://github.com/gigasquid/cats-dogs-cortex-redux/blob/master/Cats%20and%20Dogs%20in%20Cortex%20(Redux).ipynb">walkthrough in a jupyter notebook</a> with a lein-jupyter plugin.</p>

<p>The Deep Learning world in Clojure is an exciting place to be and gaining tools and traction more and more.</p>

    <id>http://gigasquid.github.io/blog/2017/10/22/embedded-interop-between-clojure-r-and-python-with-graalvm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTViY2Y0ZGItMTg2OC00YzEzLWJhYjYtZjg4OTMyOWE4YzM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTQ1NzU4Njk@._V1_.jpg">https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTViY2Y0ZGItMTg2OC00YzEzLWJhYjYtZjg4OTMyOWE4YzM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTQ1NzU4Njk@._V1_.jpg</a>" title="" ></p>

<p>In my talk at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLl6_k_fZn4">Clojure Conj</a> I mentioned how a project from Oracle Labs named GraalVM might have to potential for Clojure to interop with Python on the same VM. At the time of the talk, I had just learned about it so I didn&rsquo;t have time to take a look at it. Over the last week, I&rsquo;ve managed to take it for a test drive and I wanted to share what I found.</p>

<h3>Are you ready?</h3>

<p>In this example, we will be using an ordinary Leinengen project and using the REPL we will interop with both R and python.</p>

<p>But first will need a bit of setup.</p>

<p>We will download the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oracle-labs/program-languages/downloads/index.html">Graal project</a> so we can use its <code>java</code> instead of our own.</p>

<p>Once we have it downloaded we will configure our PATH to use Graal&rsquo;s java instead of our own.</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>export PATH=/path/to/graalAndTruffle/bin:$PATH</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now, we can create a new lein project and run <code>lein repl</code> and begin the fun.</p>

<h3>The Polyglot Context</h3>

<p>In our new namespace, we just need to import the <a href="http://graalvm.github.io/graal/truffle/javadoc/org/graalvm/polyglot/Context.html">Polyglot Context</a> to get started:</p>

<p>```clojure
(ns graal-test.core
  (:import (org.graalvm.polyglot Context)))</p>

<p>;; note that is also supports Ruby, LLVM, and JS
(def context (Context/create (into-array [&ldquo;python&rdquo; &ldquo;R&rdquo;])))
```</p>

<p>Now, we are ready to actually try to run some R and Python code right in our REPL. Let&rsquo;s start first with R.</p>

<h3>Interoping with R</h3>

<p>The main function we are going to use is the <code>eval</code> function in the context. Let&rsquo;s start small with some basic math.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(.eval context "R" "
3^2 + 2^2
")
;=&gt; #object[org.graalvm.polyglot.Value 0x7ff40e4d "13.0"]
</code></p>

<p>Wow! It actually did something. It returned something called a <a href="https://github.com/graalvm/graal/blob/master/sdk/src/org.graalvm.polyglot/src/org/graalvm/polyglot/Value.java">Polyglot Value</a> with what looks like the right answer in it.</p>

<p>Emboldened by our early success, let&rsquo;s try something a little more complicated like calling a function.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(def result1 (.eval context "R" "
sum.of.squares &lt;- function(x,y) {
  x^2 + y^2
}
sum.of.squares(3,4)
"))
;=&gt; #object[org.graalvm.polyglot.Value 0xc3edd92 "25.0"]
</code></p>

<p>Again, it looks like it worked. Let&rsquo;s try to get the result back into Clojure as a value we can work with. We could ask the result what sort of type it is with</p>

<p><code>clojure
(.isNumber result1) ;=&gt; true
</code></p>

<p>but let&rsquo;s just use <code>clojure.edn</code> to read the string and save some time.</p>

<p>```
(defn &ndash;>clojure [polyglot-value]
  (&ndash;> polyglot-value</p>

<pre><code>  (.toString)
  (clojure.edn/read-string)))
</code></pre>

<p>(&ndash;>clojure result1) ;=> 25
```</p>

<p>It would be nice to have a easier way to export symbols and import symbols to and from the guest and host language. In fact, Graal provides a way to do this but to do this in Clojure, we would need something else called <a href="https://github.com/graalvm/graal/tree/master/truffle">Truffle</a>.</p>

<p>Truffle is part of the Graal project and is a framework for implementing languages with the Graal compliler.
There are quite a few languages implemented with the Truffle framework. R is one of them.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/polyglotonthejvmwithgraalenglish-170521104613/95/polyglot-on-the-jvm-with-graal-english-14-638.jpg?cb=1495364615">https://image.slidesharecdn.com/polyglotonthejvmwithgraalenglish-170521104613/95/polyglot-on-the-jvm-with-graal-english-14-638.jpg?cb=1495364615</a>"></p>

<p>My understanding is that if Clojure was implemented as a truffle lang, then interop could be much more seamless like this example in Ruby</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/polyglotonthejvmwithgraalenglish-170521104613/95/polyglot-on-the-jvm-with-graal-english-37-638.jpg?cb=1495364615">https://image.slidesharecdn.com/polyglotonthejvmwithgraalenglish-170521104613/95/polyglot-on-the-jvm-with-graal-english-37-638.jpg?cb=1495364615</a>"></p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s continue in our exploration. What about doing something more interesting, like importing a useful R library and using it. How about the <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/numDeriv/versions/2016.8-1">numDeriv</a> package that supports Accurate Numerical Derivatives?</p>

<p>First we import the package using cran.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(.eval context "R" "
install.packages(\"numDeriv\", repos = \"http://cran.case.edu/\")
")
</code></p>

<p>If you are doing this at your REPL, you can will see lots of text going on in your <code>lein repl</code> process at this point. It&rsquo;s going out and figuring out what deps you need and installing them in your <code>/graalvm-0.28.2/jre/languages/R</code> directory structure.</p>

<p>After it is done, we can actually use it!</p>

<p>```clojure
(def result2 (.eval context &ldquo;R&rdquo; &ldquo;
library(numDeriv)
grad(sin, (0:10)<em>2</em>pi/10)
&rdquo;))
result2 ;=> #object[org.graalvm.polyglot.Value 0x76765898 &ldquo;c(1,</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>This has a bit more interesting result as an array. But the Context has ways of dealing with it.</p>

<p>```clojure
(.hasArrayElements result2) ;=> true
(.getArraySize result2) ;=> 11</p>

<p>(for [i (range 10)]
  (&ndash;> (.getArrayElement result2 i) (&ndash;>clojure)))
;=> (1.0 0.8090169943672489 0.3090169943721585 -0.3090169943735675

; 0.8090169943691851)
```</p>

<p>So, we&rsquo;ve showed basic interop with R &ndash; which is pretty neat. What about Python?</p>

<h3>Interoping with Python</h3>

<p>Truffle is scheduled to fully support Python in 2018, but there is already an early alpha version in the Graal download that we can play with.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(.eval context "python" "
import time;
time.clock()
")
 ;=&gt; #object[org.graalvm.polyglot.Value 0x4a6b3b70 "1.508202803249E9"]
</code></p>

<p>Neat!</p>

<p>It is still a long way for <code>import numpy</code> or <code>import tensorflow</code> but cPython compatibility is the goal. Although the c-extensions are the really tricky part.</p>

<p>So keep an eye on Graal and Truffle for the future and wish the Oracle Labs team the best on their mission to make the JVM Polyglot.</p>

    <id>http://gigasquid.github.io/blog/2016/12/27/deep-learning-in-clojure-with-cortex</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update: Cortex has moved along since I first wrote this blog post, so if you are looking to run the examples, please go and clone the <a href="https://github.com/thinktopic/cortex">Cortex</a> repo and look for the cats and dogs code in the examples directory.</strong></p>

<p>There is an awesome new <em>Clojure-first</em> machine learning library called <a href="https://github.com/thinktopic/cortex">Cortex</a> that was open sourced recently. I&rsquo;ve been exploring it lately and wanted to share my discoveries so far in this post. In our exploration, we are going to tackle one of the classic classification problems of the internet. How do you tell the difference between a cat and dog pic?</p>

<h2>Where to Start?</h2>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://kaggle2.blob.core.windows.net/competitions/kaggle/3362/media/woof_meow.jpg">http://kaggle2.blob.core.windows.net/competitions/kaggle/3362/media/woof_meow.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>For any machine learning problem, we&rsquo;re going to need data. For this, we can use Kaggle&rsquo;s data for the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data">Cats vs Dogs Challenge</a>.  The training data consists of 25,000 images of cats and dogs. That should be more than enough to train our computer to recognize cats from doggies.</p>

<p>We also need some idea of how to train against the data. Luckily, the Cortex project has a very nice set of examples to help you get started. In particular there is a <a href="https://github.com/thinktopic/cortex/tree/master/examples/suite-classification">suite classification example</a> using MNIST, (hand written digit), corpus. This example contains a number cutting edge features that we&rsquo;ll want to use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Uses GPU for <em>fast</em> computation.</li>
<li>Uses a deep, multi-layered, convolutional layered network for feature recognition.</li>
<li>Has &ldquo;forever&rdquo; training by image augmentation.</li>
<li>Saves the network configuration as it trains to an external nippy file so that it can be imported later.</li>
<li>Has a really nice ClojureScript front end to visualize the training progress with a confusion matrix.</li>
<li>Has a way to import the saved nippy network configuration and perform inference on it to classify a new image.</li>
</ul>


<p>Basically, it has everything we need to hit the ground running.</p>

<h2>Data Wrangling</h2>

<p>To use the example&rsquo;s <em>forever</em> training, we need to get the data in the right form. We need all the images to be the same size as well as in a directory structure that is split up into the training and test images. Furthermore, we want all the dog images to be under a &ldquo;dog&rdquo; directory and the cat images under the &ldquo;cat&rdquo; directory so that the all the indexed images under them have the correct &ldquo;label&rdquo;.  It will look like this:</p>

<p>```
&ndash; training
  &ndash; cat</p>

<pre><code>- 1.png
- 2.png
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>dog

<ul>
<li>1.png</li>
<li>2.png
```</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>For this task, we are going to use a couple image libraries to help us out:</p>

<p><code>clojure
 [mikera.image.core :as imagez]
 [think.image.image :as image]
</code></p>

<p>We can resize and rewrite the original images into the form we want. For a image size, we&rsquo;re going to go with 52x52. The choice is arbitrary in that I wanted it bigger than the MNIST dataset which is 28x28 so it will be easier to see, but not so big that it kills my CPU. This is even more important since we want to use RGB colors which is 3 channels as opposed to the MNIST grey scale of 1.</p>

<p>```clojure
(def dataset-image-size 52)
(def dataset-num-classes 2)
(def dataset-num-channels 3)
(def dataset-datatype :float)</p>

<p>(defn resize-and-write-data
  [output-dir [idx [file label]]]
  (let [img-path (str output-dir &ldquo;/&rdquo; label &ldquo;/&rdquo; idx &ldquo;.png&rdquo; )]</p>

<pre><code>(when-not (.exists (io/file img-path))
  (io/make-parents img-path)
  (-&gt; (imagez/load-image file)
      (image/resize dataset-image-size dataset-image-size)
      (imagez/save img-path)))
nil))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>As far as the split between training images and testing images, we are going the go for an simple even split between testing and training data.</p>

<h2>Network Configuration</h2>

<p>The Network layer configuration is the meat of the whole thing. We are going to go with the exact same network description as the MNIST example:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(defn create-basic-network-description
  []
  [(desc/input dataset-image-size dataset-image-size dataset-num-channels)
   (desc/convolutional 5 0 1 20)
   (desc/max-pooling 2 0 2)
   (desc/relu)
   (desc/convolutional 5 0 1 50)
   (desc/max-pooling 2 0 2)
   (desc/relu)
   (desc/convolutional 1 0 1 50)
   (desc/relu)
   (desc/linear-&gt;relu 1000)
   (desc/dropout 0.5)
   (desc/linear-&gt;softmax dataset-num-classes)])
</code></p>

<p>It uses a series of convolutional layers with max pooling for feature recognition. We&rsquo;ll see if it works for color versions of cats and dogs as well as street numbers.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll also keep the image augmentation the same as in the example.</p>

<p>```clojure
(def max-image-rotation-degrees 25)</p>

<p>(defn img-aug-pipeline
  [img]
  (&ndash;> img</p>

<pre><code>  (image-aug/rotate (- (rand-int (* 2 max-image-rotation-degrees))
                       max-image-rotation-degrees)
                    false)
  (image-aug/inject-noise (* 0.25 (rand)))))
</code></pre>

<p>(def ^:dynamic <em>num-augmented-images-per-file</em> 1)
```</p>

<p>It injects one augmented image into our training data by slightly rotating it and adding noise.</p>

<h3>Running it!</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to test it out. Using <code>lein run</code>, we&rsquo;ll launch the <code>train-forever</code> function:</p>

<p>```clojure
(defn train-forever
  []
  (let [dataset (create-dataset)</p>

<pre><code>    initial-description (create-basic-network-description)
    confusion-matrix-atom (display-dataset-and-model dataset initial-description)]
(classification/train-forever dataset observation-&gt;image
                              initial-description
                              :confusion-matrix-atom confusion-matrix-atom)))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This opens a port to a localhost webpage where we can view the progress <code>http://localhost:8091/</code></p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://c3.staticflickr.com/1/599/31877481106_ab49402b71_b.jpg">http://c3.staticflickr.com/1/599/31877481106_ab49402b71_b.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Below the confusion matrix is shown. This tracks the progress of the training in the classification. In particular, how many times it thought a cat was really a cat and how many times it got it wrong.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://c7.staticflickr.com/1/371/31541533750_69d80cc7fa.jpg">http://c7.staticflickr.com/1/371/31541533750_69d80cc7fa.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>As we are training the data, the loss for each epoch is shown on the console as well as when it saves the network to the external file.</p>

<p>After only thirty minutes of training on my Mac Book Pro, we get to some pretty good results, with the correct percentage in the 99s :</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://c1.staticflickr.com/1/707/31541538600_8e61134375.jpg">http://c1.staticflickr.com/1/707/31541538600_8e61134375.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to do some inference on our trained network.</p>

<h2>Inference</h2>

<p>Firing up a REPL we can connect to our namespace and use the <code>label-one</code> function from the cortex example to spot check our classification. It reads in the external nippy file that contains the trained network description, takes a random image from the testing directory, and classifies it.</p>

<p>```clojure
(defn label-one
  &ldquo;Take an arbitrary image and label it.&rdquo;
  []
  (let [file-label-pairs (shuffle (classification/directory->file-label-seq testing-dir</p>

<pre><code>                                                                        false))
    [test-file test-label] (first file-label-pairs)
    test-img (imagez/load-image test-file)
    observation (png-&gt;observation dataset-datatype false test-img)]
(imagez/show test-img)
(infer/classify-one-observation (:network-description
                                 (suite-io/read-nippy-file "trained-network.nippy"))
                                observation
                                (ds/create-image-shape dataset-num-channels
                                                       dataset-image-size
                                                       dataset-image-size)
                                dataset-datatype
                                (classification/get-class-names-from-directory testing-dir))))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Running <code>(label-one)</code> gives us the picture:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://c2.staticflickr.com/1/423/31105658073_b6143b2f00.jpg">http://c2.staticflickr.com/1/423/31105658073_b6143b2f00.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>and classifies it as a cat. Yipee!</p>

<p><code>clojure
{:probability-map {"cat" 0.9995587468147278, "dog" 4.4119369704276323E-4}, :classification "cat"}
</code></p>

<p>Not bad, but let&rsquo;s try it with something harder. Personally, I&rsquo;m not even sure whether this is a cat or a dog.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://c6.staticflickr.com/1/596/31105666133_223dc2f04e_c.jpg">http://c6.staticflickr.com/1/596/31105666133_223dc2f04e_c.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Feeding it through the program &ndash; it says it is a cat.</p>

<p><code>clojure
 {:probability-map {"cat" 0.9942012429237366, "dog" 0.005798777565360069}, :classification "cat"}
</code></p>

<p>After much <a href="http://www.today.com/pets/cat-or-dog-wild-eyed-cutie-has-us-all-confused-t104835">debate on the internet</a>, I think that is the best answer the humans got too :)</p>

<h2>Kaggle it</h2>

<p>So it seems like we have a pretty good model, why don&rsquo;t we submit our results to the Kaggle competition and see how it rates. All they need is to have us run the classification against their test data of 12,500 images and classify them as 1 = dog or 0 = cat in a csv format.</p>

<p>We will take each image and resize it, then feed it into cortex&rsquo;s <code>infer-n-observations</code> function, to do all our classification as a batch.</p>

<p>```clojure
 (infer/infer-n-observations (:network-description</p>

<pre><code>                                         (suite-io/read-nippy-file "trained-network.nippy"))
                                        observations
                                        (ds/create-image-shape dataset-num-channels
                                                               dataset-image-size
                                                               dataset-image-size)
                                        dataset-datatype)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Finally, we just need to format our results to a csv file and export it:</p>

<p>```clojure
(defn write-kaggle-results [results]
  (with-open [out-file (io/writer &ldquo;kaggle-results.csv&rdquo;)]</p>

<pre><code>(csv/write-csv out-file
               (into [["id" "label"]]
                     (-&gt; (mapv (fn [[id class]] [(Integer/parseInt id) (if (= "dog" class) 1 0)]) results)
                         (sort))))))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>After uploading the file to the Kaggle, I was pleased that the answer got in the top 91%! It made it on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/leaderboard">Leaderboard</a>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Using an example setup from the Cortex project and 30 minutes of processing time on my laptop, we were able to crunch through some significant data and come up with a trained classification model that was good enough to make the charts in the Kaggle competition. On top of it all, it is in pure Clojure.</p>

<p>In my mind, this is truely impressive and even though the Cortex library is in it&rsquo;s early phases, it puts it on track to be as useful a tool as Tensor Flow for Machine Learning.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, I watched an ACM Learning webcast with Peter Norvig speaking on AI. In it, he spoke of one of the next challenges of AI which is to combine <a href="https://twitter.com/gigasquid/status/806916856040689664?lang=en">symbolic with neural</a>. I can think of no better language than Clojure with it&rsquo;s simplicity, power, and rich LISP heritage to take on the challenge for the future. With the Cortex library, it&rsquo;s off to a great start.</p>
