	<div class="entry-content"><p>I have always wanted to contribute to Open Source.  I have reaped the benefits of using Open Source packages throughout the years, I sincerely want to give back.  What has been stopping me all this time?      Lack of time is my main excuse.  I have two small children and by the time I clean up from dinner and get them bathed and off to bed, there is little time left to code.   I tend to use this excuse for lots of other tasks that I avoid around the house, like closet cleaning, reorganizing the garage, etc …  But an excuse is exactly what it is.</p>

<p>I learned an invaluable technique to tackling projects around the house that I would like to get done, but seem too large or for some other reason have become subject to procrastination.  First, I schedule a day to do something about it and then I put on a timer and just start doing it for 15 minutes.  After 15 minutes, I am officially done.  I can quit with no guilt and have the lovely feeling of having made a dent.  Most often, once I get started, I want to keep with it and really get rolling.  That&rsquo;s OK too.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday, I decided to apply this technique and made a date with Open Source.  After a Ruby user group, the night before,  demonstrated the mechanics of fixing a bug using GitHub, I was finally confident enough to give it a go myself.  I created a GitHub account, forked the Redmine project, fixed a bite-sized bug and submitted a patch – all in one night!</p>

<p>I was so jazzed up about it, that I decided that I was going to continue in my Open Source contribution quest on a limited time budget, by declaring that my Wednesday night is my Open Source night.  It might only be 15 or 30 min, but I will be doing something and feeling that contribution buzz goodness.</p>

<p>I encourage everyone that has been struggling to find time for Open Source to just schedule one night a week.  Just do something for 15 min and see what flows …</p>
